There’s a fair amount of material here, so take it bit by bit. You don’t need to read this thing from start to finish, take whatever sections interest you or seem applicable, and use them.

Suggestions

If you are trying to learn new motor skills, check out X. If you are trying to learn or maintain repertoire, such as songs, pieces, song structures, seewhy.
