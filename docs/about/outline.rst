* :ref:`part-1-on-technique` explains playing guitar as a process of your nervous system, and from there discusses speed and tension.  It also explains why the "intuitive method" of practice doesn't work, and what a more effective practice routine is.  Fundamentally, technique is about ease in playing -- how at home you are at the instrument, and how practice and playing is about aligning your brain, nerves, and muscles to all work together fluidly.

* :ref:`part-2-getting-organized` is about getting organized, scheduling, etc.  How long should you practice?  How should you track things?

* :ref:`part-3-techniques` is the most involved and interesting part.  It offers several practice techniques you can use to help you master techniques, licks, and songs more quickly and thoroughly.

* :ref:`part-5-appendices` is reference material.

There's a fair amount of material in here, so take it bit by bit.  Parts I, II, and IV should be quick-ish to read.  Part III, the practice techniques, are things to try out as you feel you need them.
