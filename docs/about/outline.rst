:ref:`part-1-on-technique` explains playing guitar as a process of your nervous system, and from there discusses speed and tension.  It also explains why the "intuitive method" of practice doesn't work, and what a more effective practice routine is.  Fundamentally, technique is about ease in playing -- how at home you are at the instrument, and how practice and playing is about aligning your brain, nerves, and muscles to all work together fluidly.

:ref:`part-2-setting-up` is about getting organized, scheduling, etc.  How long should you practice?  How should you track things?  Some of this may be obvious to you, but maybe not.

:ref:`part-3-techniques` is the most involved and interesting part.  It offers several practice techniques you can use to help you master techniques, licks, and songs more quickly and thoroughly.  The introduction to that section gives some pointers on how to use the techniques.

:ref:`part-4-misc` is, well, everything I wanted to add, but couldn't think of where to put it (e.g., improvisation and memorization).  There is a boatload of information out there about some of the items covered in this section, but I wanted to add a few points for your consideration.

:ref:`part-5-appendices` is reference material.
