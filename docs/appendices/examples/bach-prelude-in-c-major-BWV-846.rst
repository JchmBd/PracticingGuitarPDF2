.. todo:: fill in content here


Items to cover:

* add practice notes to book
* started from the end
* listened to 2 recordings
* worked out trouble spots
* had everything more or less memorized, but (along with general roughness) could isolate a few spots where things particularly fell apart.  Identified those and practiced them separately

* simple piece, but some good things to cover
* overview of piece, listening to examples
* performance choices - articulation, etc
* the practice schedule - 20 mins for each chunk, then move along to next one
* mental practice of overall structure
* backchaining for memorization
* chaining to deal with problem sections
  * final G with weird pull offs
  * F - F#o
  * F#o - Abo
  * Go - Dm/F
* simplify - just shifting chords
* things that should have been easy, but weren't -- 7x20
  * G7 with open strings
  * first chords!!!
* dropping notes - to pull out the bass line
* slow practice, of course, for changes, right hand, tension everywhere
* other technical notes:
  * tension
  * barre chords are tough
* my own practice log for this piece

.. todo:: consider pulling out examples to part 4!
