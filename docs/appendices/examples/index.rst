Applying the ideas in this book to pieces, licks, and techniques.

This section shows how I have applied the techniques in this book to practising real repertoire and technique. I’m using myself as an example, because I want these to be realistic. Really, I can only speak from my own experience, but hopefully it’s useful. Take everything I say here as just suggestions or possibilities for your own practice. I if you have a specific question, let me know in the feedback. Good luck!

All practice things have one main thing in common: the schedule.  Practice things in, say, 20 minute chunks, keeping track of stuff in some kind of journal.  Link.
