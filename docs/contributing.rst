My biggest hope for this project is that the information reaches a wide audience, so that players can get some new ideas on how they can make their practicing more successful.  Nothing is ever gospel, but sometimes a small hint is all that it takes for things to really *click*, and it would be extremely gratifying to have this information be that catalyst!

There are a few ways that you can help this site reach that goal:

Share it
^^^^^^^^

If anything here has helped you, let others know!  Share on Reddit, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube -- wherever you keep in contact with your guitar community.  If you teach, perhaps it will help your students structure their work, or if you have a teacher, see what they think.  Information is only useful if shared.

Testimonials
^^^^^^^^^^^^

One day, I hope to have a page on this site with testimonials from players that have been helped by any of the practice approaches or techniques.  This might encourage other newcomers to give things a try, and see if it works for them.  A short note would be appreciated!  See the :doc:`feedback` for ways to reach me.

Contribute examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you've used these ideas to master some repertoire or technique, maybe you'd consider creating a page for :ref:`part-4-examples` to demonstrate and clarify how you actually used these ideas.  I'll work with you to ensure that the tone fits well with the rest of the info in this book.  Optionally, you could post it on your own blog, channel, or whatever, and I'll happily link back to that.

Feedback and questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Feedback always helps: questions, corrections, suggestions, etc: all are welcome.  See :doc:`feedback`.

Money
^^^^^

This project is one of my ways of saying thanks to the various teachers and thinkers who offered information and ideas to their students and readers (see the :ref:`references`).  While I did spend the time putting together this information and occasionally reinterpreting it for guitar, I can't take credit for the core ideas; I can only hope that this will help the information reach a wider audience.

So, I'm not asking for any compensation.  If you *really* want to give me money, please donate that same sum to your nearest women's health org, animal shelter, or any cause you deem worthy.  Or call that friend you've been meaning to and say hi.  Or surprise a stranger with a free coffee.  Then we can say we're even.  Cheers!
