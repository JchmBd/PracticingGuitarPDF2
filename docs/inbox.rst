How to use this book
--------------------

There’s a fair amount of material here, so take it bit by bit. You don’t need to read this thing from start to finish, take whatever sections interest you or seem applicable, and use them.

User Tracks
-----------

If you’re a beginner, take a look at some of the basic techniques.

If you are interested in in the mechanics of practicing, and how your nervous system manages everything, check out section X.

If you are trying to learn new motor skills, check out X. If you are trying to learn or maintain repertoire, such as songs, pieces, song structures, seewhy.

Since tension is such a big problem in playing, and can accumulate even at a subconscious level, I really recommend the section said.

Q and A
-------

**Why should I listen to you?**

Good question, and that’s not what this book is about. This is not a collection of recommendations of things you should do during practicing. In my opinion, no one can really teach you how to play, they can just give suggestions and demonstrations. It’s up to you to work on those, and make them part of your physical and mental playing.

Instead of looking at these as recommendations, or even suggestions, look at them as a starting point for your own experiments and investigation. I would rather you think of these things as a conversation that you are having with yourself, rather or one that we are having together, rather than a one way flow of information.

**Which techniques should I use?**

See the technique ratings index to see the techniques in rating order. Maybe try the highest rated ones first, and see how they feel.

**My favourite technique is not listed here.**

Please let me know in the suggestions. I’ve tried to include things with a minimum of redundancy, but maybe I’ve missed some thing obvious I would be very interested to hear it!



**My teacher/favorite guitar instructor on YouTube/favorite player doesn’t use any of these techniques.**

I believe that these techniques are useful, but after some experimentation, you might not agree. That’s fine. These techniques are not a replacement for any existing practice routine you might follow. If you already have a successful routine, and you are happy with your progress, that’s fantastic.  But if you are not sure how to practice, if you can’t seem to define a and effective routine, or you are not making progress, the kind of progress you want, then maybe some of these ideas will help.

**I doubt that Eddie Van Halen/inveigh mom Steen/Sean Lane/Paul Gilbert used any of these techniques.**

Good point, and some or all of what is outlined here might feel overly analytical to some or to you.  I’ve been playing for a long time, but I am not I would not consider myself a natural. For the players mentioned above, they may have been they may be wired differently from the rest of us, and happened to find the secrets for their technique by instinct, rather than consciously. If your instinct leads you successfully, then you probably don’t need practice tips.  Unfortunately, instinct and enthusiasm can sometimes lead you astray, and you need to spend some time thinking about things.


What this book is not
---------------------

This book does not contain, or tries to avoid, any suggested practice licks or scales, or even or even scaler variations or arpeggios. There are loads of tutorials and licks on YouTube and on websites such as the following: give example here. So, i’m less interested in providing yet another list of lakes and scales for you to work on, and more on how you can practice those licks and scales to your best advantage.

In some cases, I will offer some well intentioned advice. I hope you consider it, but if it doesn’t suit you, no worriesl

Why wrote this book
-------------------

I study piano for a time, and piano has a bunch of great literature on effective practice techniques and musicianship in general.  See the references for some of the sources I found interesting. While some are better than others, all of them offer interesting approaches to practicing.

For a guitar, and rock guitar in particular, the amount of information available is enormous.  There are several hundreds of teachers available on YouTube on websites, in guitar magazines etc. But, with few exceptions, most I did not find that most of them I did not find many of them offering the same practice tips as from piano teachers.  This book is a collection of what I consider to be the best tips from these teachers and sources, in some cases presented with no modification, and in others presented with specific adjustments for guitar.


Notes from notes.org
====================

** Fingers vs arms 

The piano literature often deals with finger motions vs arm motiions.  With the picking hand this is is still valid; with the fetting hand, while it may seem that fingers alone carry the day, the arm / wrist rotation could be useful here too.

** Central nervous sys

Kochevitsky: "When forced to new multiform adjustments, the motor activity of those lower divisions is overburdened with unnecessary concomitant movements and muscle overtensions. And often at first it does not accomplish a given task expeditiously. Externally this is expressed in awkwardness and clumsiness. But gradually the cortex learns to master the subordinated mechanisms, to reorganize their work. It adds purposefulness to motor acts: regulated by the highest centers, motor activity now becomes “thinkingly directed,” skillful and graceful in appearance, and also more flexible. As a consequence, muscles have to perform their activity in somewhat different ways. Their contractions arise rapidly, last a very short time, and constantly interchange with relaxations. The motor apparatus now has much more to do. It seems to serve more masters now, to serve many new incoming demands."

Conscious mind sets the direction, and tries some clumsy method.  Then you have to get out of the conscious mind, to push the techniue along so the subconscious processes take over.  You were never really in control anyway: the sub was making scores of adjustments as you played.  So perhap playing fast, really fast, while still keping the necessary relaxation in place so as to not introduce new conflicting information to the CNS (cent nerv syst), is the best way to take the routine out of the domain of the conscious mind, and to hand the keys to the sub.

Optionally, distract the con mind with something -- watching TV.  But keep in mind that it's a good idea to direct the consc mind to the playing very frequently, to monitor and observe.  It's easy to pick up bad technique unnoticed.

Play in bursts, to get the benefit of both.  The con mind needs to establish the goal, organize the rough sequence of movements, and start the process.  The sub then takes over to deliver, with the con mind evaluating, and perhaps jumping in to adjust as you go.  Then the sub stops, and cons mind evaluates again.  The consc mind can also help push you along -- faster, faster, easier, easier.

"It frequently happens that even the pianist with some experience, as well as the beginner, is unable to achieve complete relaxation of his arms. When he wants his arm to fall down of its own weight, the extrapyramidal complex interferes instantly and prevents free fall. This physiological law of balancing our body and extremities in space is accomplished automatically by the cerebellum and is present constantly when the arm is in a horizontal position, as in piano playing. When the pupil’s attention is concentrated mainly on his finger activity, the amount of normal tension necessary for that balancing can be exceeded, resulting in muscle overexertion."

Subc elements of the CNS have been trained to do certain things - balance, etc - but often these can be maladjusted.  Also, in some cases like mine, years of playing resulted in a mass of tension throughout my hands, wrists, and arms.  I'd thought that was necessary, and developed techniques which served in limited situations.  It was certainly inflexible.  My conditioned reflex when picking up the guitar was to immediately tense up -- I thought that was "readiness".

"Careful control over sensations arising during movements (though not the detailed control dreamed of by the anatomic-physiological school) helps to exclude unnecessary exertions. If the higher centers do not prevail, the lower ones act independently, and the organized coordination is disarranged, the precision and smooth velocity of movement are disturbed."

We all have a baseline level of tension -- and we need to get rid of it to allow the sub elements freer play.

** physiology - nerve impulses

"The entire route traveled by the nerve impulse from peripheral receptor through the transmitting afferent nerve fibers to the brain, and outward through efferent nerve fibers extending to certain executive organs, is called the reflex arc. Training establishes a conditioned reflex arc by repeatedly connecting any given sensory stimulation with a particular motor activity."

** Inhibition vs excitation

"When a stimulus creates excitation, the result is a discharge of impulses. Inhibition suppresses superfluous (or even harmful) excitation ... Since fast, even piano playing is the result of precise balance between these two basic processes of nervous activity, both processes require special training, particularly the inhibitory."

When you play, your subconscious is sending impulses to muscles to contract.  Just as important as the contraction is the relaxation when the required movement is complete, so the muscle is ready for the next impules.  If there's any residual tension, the next signal is lost ... things tense up.

TIPS for inhibition:

Slow and extremely even playing is indispensable, not only for obtaining clear proprioceptive sensations but for strengthening the inhibitory process.

Stopping practice should be used not only to control what you just did and what you are going to do, but to force yourself to detain the impulse for the next movement for as long as you want at any given moment. This is an excellent means for strengthening inhibition. It is especially hard to stop before strong beats.

Practice pianissimo, extremely evenly, in slow and fast tempos.

Increase and decrease the volume or aggression, and stop at arbitrary sections.

"The student should also be able to regulate both sudden and gradual increase or decrease in volume in any section of the composition and in any conceivable tempo. The ability to do this, plus the ability to slow down and to stop at any given moment, is the best proof of proper balance between excitatory and inhibitory processes."

FH practicing: Try raising the fingers slightly before bringing them down, for legato practice:

"In the central nervous system, reciprocal relations exist between flexors (bending muscles) and extensors (straightening muscles). The intense excitation of flexors will call forth intense inhibition of extensors, and vice versa. Since the inhibitory process is weaker than the process of excitation, a slight raising of fingers (intense excitation of extensors) before their descent into the keys appears to be a valuable means for strengthening weak inhibition of flexors."

Interest is key: create your own exercises based on your own tunes, licks, and techniques:

"Pavlov’s followers tell us about a hypothetical focusing, orienting, investigating reflex which implies the condition of motivation and seems to be related to evoking a state of alertness or attentiveness in the central nervous system. Called the reflex of purpose, it does not culminate in a definite external reaction. But elicited and strengthened by some circumstance (in our case, a strong desire directed toward realizing a vivid musical image on the piano), it expresses itself in functional change and increased excitability of the whole nervous system (a state of raised emotions, enthusiasm). The result is heightened activity of definite relevant nervous elements while other points of the central nervous system, due to the law of reciprocal induction, are in a greater or lesser degree inhibited."

"The process of coupling two nervous points, of laying a new neural path, cannot take place if we are in a state of fatigue or drowsiness or if our mind is not free from irrelevant activity."

Play, and evaluate: "We should point out that pupils are often inclined to repeat a passage in fast succession, starting the next repetition when the preceding one is hardly finished. In correct practicing, a slight pause (several seconds) must be inserted between repetitions, to give the pianist time to check whether everything just performed was correct and the results were musically satisfactory, and to prepare himself mentally for the next repetition. Conscious effort can help in organizing the process of practicing, and so facilitate the work and shorten the time needed for achieving the goal. But comprehension cannot replace necessary practicing. The necessary number of repetitions and length of period needed for assimilation of a new combination of movements depend on several circumstances. The most important are: (1) the complexity of a given motor form; (2) the type of nervous system of a given individual; (3) the concentration of his attention; (4) the previously established connections." 

Rest is key: "Sometimes excessive industry and strenuous practicing can result in failure. The more persistently one tries, the worse the results, Fatigue of the central nervous system, which is not noticed by the player, is the reason for this failure. When in despair he abandons his efforts and later resumes his work, he notices that many, if not all, obstacles are miraculously gone. Fatigue is alleviated by rest. With a fresh start, the results of previous practicing show themselves clearly." 

Pay close attention to tone!  Different pick angles, hand positions, speed of attack, pick depth, all play a role in tone.  These will challenge the nervous system, and increase engagement with the playing.

Starting: "In the initial period of study, the pupil should concentrate on tone production, starting from single, separate tones, with attention on tone quality, proprioceptive sensations and form of movement, all three closely united."

Music v technique: "The musical idea, always going slightly ahead, should stimulate technical development. If technical aspects take the leading role, there is the danger of degradation into superficial virtuosity. How many pianists have fallen prey to this danger!"

"Contrary to what one might think, training the weaker inhibitory process which regulates movement is more important for the development of speed (and more difficult for the cortex) than training excitation."

relaxation
----------

Our whole playing apparatus (and this includes not
only the arm and the muscles of the back but also the
feet in operating the pedals) must be absolutely free in
its movements and in its inner muscular functions.

But the normal muscle contraction is far from being a
cramp and is absolutely necessary for any motor activity.
A muscle is capable of any degree of contraction; the time
of this contraction varies from a fraction of a second to the
point where fatigue begins. For piano technique, the
short-lasting muscle contractions are of particular importance, And so we should talk, not about relaxation, but
rather about the degree of muscle contraction needed for
this or that motor act.

It is weak
static tension stimulating cortical activity that exerts the
most favorable influence on muscle preparedness and innervation.



Fast play degradation
---------------------

Hey there.  Short answer: yes, me too.

For a possible remedy: this is a long answer to a short question, but it gives me a chance to organize some thinking and get some writing on this topic done.  I know you didn't ask for a huge essay, but maybe something here will help.

TL/DR: you're experiencing what some have called "Fast play degradation".  Essentially:

- (a) the theory goes that your brain/nervous system can't organize the complex input it got during your practicing.  My recommendation:
- (b) Try to break up your long practicing of a given lick into shorter durations,
- (c) ensure that you can successfully execute something within that short session, and
- (d) be sure to end any given practice session of a lick with a perfect slow rendition of the thing you've practiced.

All right, that's a lot of stuff.  A few more notes for the above:

a) nervous system.  Some great piano documents talk about the primary role of the nervous system in piano playing, and having worked on it a bit for guitar I think it's the case.  Playing isn't about muscles, it's about your nervous system adapting, especially for "fast twitch" things like picking and fretting.  For improvement to happen, your practice sessions need to present a clear picture to your nervous system about what you're trying to do (I posted about this in [this link](https://forum.troygrady.com/t/your-practice-schedule-for-acquiring-new-motor-skills/42527) ).  If you're working at something quite beyond your current abilities, this input might be really chaotic and disorganized.  I'm not saying you need to aim lower :-) but you could try some adjustments.

Everything that follows is my suggestion only.  My tone may come across as an order or command, but please modify everything I say to suit you; however, if you're stuck, maybe trying something different is called for.

b) practice duration.  In that same thread I mentioned practicing something for about 15 mins, and then coming back to it later the same day.  This could be like "interleaved practice" as mentioned about, but you could also just take a break -- get some water, clean your room, walk the dog -- and come back to it.  This is a good method because it lets you really work hard on something and really pay attention, and the short duration and break gives your nervous system time to process.  Slaving away for hours at a lick is counterproductive: your nerves/brain are tire and won't adapt.  Practice anywhere from 5 to 15 mins, until you feel like you've accomplished something, but then stop and take that break!  Don't be "virtuous" and continue working, you might not be helping.  Come back to it later that day if you want to continue.  Also, during that 15 mins, take some micro breaks to think about what you're doing, what you've done, where you're going etc, it helps.

c) perfect execution.  This one is tougher ... you have to aim to play something perfectly within your 15 mins at least once, and ideally should play it perfectly a few times.  This gives your brain and nervous system something to latch on to, so it can adapt during your rest periods.

I said "play something perfectly" and not "play the lick perfectly", because often a single lick comprises several ideas.  Something as "simple" as this:

    --------------5-7-8-5-7-8-
    --5-6-8-5-6-8-------------

has these challenges:

- raw picking speed (tremelo)
- raw fretting speed (fretting only, no picking)
- fast picking of notes on a single string (e.g. "-5-6-8-") - hand sync issues, raw picking and fretting speed, relaxation, timing
- the goddam string change

If you're playing a lick and falling apart in the middle of it (ranging from a total train wreck to small-seeming things like rhythmic inconsistences, or simply acquired mental or physical tension), then you might want to break it down further into components and work on those.  e.g., there's no reason to work on the full lick above at a given speed if you can't pick the much simpler "-5-6-8-5-6-8-5-6-8-5-6-8-..." at a much higher speed with high rhythmic accuracy.

So, maybe analyze the full lick, see where your playing is falling apart, and see if that single issue can be isolated and worked on.  Some things (like the string shift) are hard to work on in isolation, but if you perfect the other tihngs (picking, left hand, rhythm) you can focus on those.  And play these little things perfectly :-)  Keep pushing that tempo way up!  Sloppy is ok while you're working it out!  But keep aiming for perfection of small bits, your brain will thank you.

(d) end with slow.  After 15 mins of intense work, your nerves will be frazzled and your mind tired.  It's gotten a lot of confusing input.  To ensure that it's clear what you've been working on, play that thing you've worked on through slowly at least once, mimicking the motions you do at high speed if you can -- i.e., don't play it slowly with a completely different technique (this can be tough, depending on what you're working on).  This is like the "cool down" of a workout, but it's more important for your nerves to help them organize.  I hope you'd get a feeling of satisfaction with this, it's supposed to be a fun relaxed wrap-up of your burst of hard work.

* "Freeing the Caged Bird" by Barbara Lister-Sink

https://www.lister-sinkinstitute.org/freeing-the-caged-bird-dvd

I found this video incredibly helpful and practical.  In this video (excerpt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cVLmQE7_Vs), she outlines the steps to eliminate chronic muscle tension:

 1. Regain awareness of the state of the tensed muscles
 2. Regain conscious control of the tensed muscles
 3. Learn and apply the principles and sensations of efficient muscle use

In particular, she outlines a "Basic Stroke" (excerpt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjSWu8ZADzI), a concise breakdown of the act of playing a note at the piano:

 1. Easy efficient lift of the forearm
 2. Free fall of forearm
 3. Optimal bone alignment and muscular contraction
 4. Instantaneous release

Her work is well worth checking out!  https://www.lister-sinkinstitute.org/

* "The Art of Piano Playing, a Scientific Approach" by George Kochevitsky

https://www.amazon.com/Art-Piano-Playing-Scientific-Approach/dp/0874870682

Though less immediately practical than Lister-Sink's video, this book made me think of guitar playing more as a process controlled by the subconscious and the central nervous system ... in other words, not muscles, and not muscular tension.  It describes motions as a combination of excitatory and inhibitory signals, that is, muscle contraction and relaxation.  Since I always got locked up with tension when guitar playing, I felt I was missing the inhibitory training necessary.

In retrospect, eliminating excess tension using the ideas from the "Freeing the Caged Bird" video could help the central nervous system as well, because there would be less noise, allowing for finer adjustments and control by the subconscious ... but who knows.


* Kochevitsky notes


** Quotes

*** Practicing at the piano is mainly practicing of the central nervous system, whether we are aware of it or not. Misconceptions of the past have led to inefficient practicing, unproductive expenditure of time, and often deplorable results.

*** It was believed that one could develop his fingers successfully only when their action was isolated from the “disadvantageous” influence of the hand and arm.

*** Chopin teaching: Five-finger exercises as well as scales were to be played with various degrees of nonlegato touch at first, and only afterwards was legato to be introduced.

*** "Schumann believed that the ability to listen to oneself was most important to a musician-performer. He suggested that the pianist first mentally perceive the essence of a composition instead of digging and hacking “away at it, bar by bar.” He wrote: “Do not play the musical composition before you can hear it inwardly.” “The finger must do what the head wills, not vice versa.””

Follows the suggestion that people record themselves and listen.  Also, take time between each rep.  This may give the nervous system chance to regulate and organize itself.

*** "Liszt was not a “professor of piano.” He did not talk about technique: pupils were supposed to work this out for themselves."

*** Liszt and technique vs music

"Only the strength of musical imagination
can guide one in his search for technical skill and show
him the right direction: the body will find the necessary
movements for realizing the musical idea. Technique not
only serves the artistic goal but is itself generated by the
tonal image.

*** technique is nervous system

the secret of
their virtuosity was located in their central nervous systems. Their virtuosity consisted in unusually fast and fine
perception of auditory and muscle sensations, in very
rapid transmission of the commands of brain to muscles,
and in the fine gradations in strength and timing of
motor impulses.

*** Raif

organic change in the musculature, as the result of long practicing, can express itself in increased strength and endurance but not in increased dexterity. 

“We have to develop in our pupils not finger dexterity but mind dexterity.”

*** Steinhausen

Since every movement is initiated in the central nervous system, practicing is, first and foremost, a psychic process, the working over of accumulated bodily experiences and the adjustment to a definite purpose. Our
whole organism shows an endless multitude of adjustments to nature and its forces, as well as adjustment of
its own parts to each other. Much of this adjustment is
evidently inborn; the rest is acquired during the development of the organism. Practice and adjustment embrace
our whole being and life. The kind, degree and dimension of this adjustment are always regulated by the central nervous system.

The process of this purposeful adjustment is so infallible that it can seem mechanical to a superficial observer and so can lead to some wrong conclusions. In our
everyday movements we act automatically. But this automatism is nevertheless a psychic process and has its seat
in the central nervous system—not, as one would assume,
in the fingers and muscles. The fastest movement, even
though it seems to become mechanical, still is a psychic
occurrence.

We do not know which group of muscles participates
in this or that movement. Even if we did, this knowledge
would not help us since we cannot command our muscles
consciously and directly. The choice of necessary muscles
takes place unconsciously, but nonetheless surely, and
accomplishes the exclusion of all unsuitable intertcring
muscles. Beginning practice starts with too much expenditure of force. The elimination of too much muscle action
is the real basis for developing agility. As a result of
practicing, we learn to make the fluent, sure and fast
movement which uses exactly as much muscle force as
is needed for a given purpose.

*** mind

achieve technique, not by the amount of time spent in
practicing, but by the quality of this labor, by the strength
of will and attention directing the mind on musical problems. Hugo Riemann wrote: “It is impossible to develop
velocity otherwise than through exercise of the telegraphic
apparatus from brain to muscles. The process from withinoutward cannot be replaced by anything.” Theodor
Leschetizky used to say that intellect played the chief
part in correct study; he recommended correcting mistakes mentally before playing a passage again.

It is evident, then, that the main attention of thoughtful pianists and piano teachers should be directed to
questions connected with the activity of the central nervous system. The roots of technique are in our central
nervous system, The problems connected with muscular
conditions and outward appearance of our playing apparatus are important, but they are secondary.
