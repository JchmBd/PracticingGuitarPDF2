Fast play degradation
---------------------

Hey there.  Short answer: yes, me too.

For a possible remedy: this is a long answer to a short question, but it gives me a chance to organize some thinking and get some writing on this topic done.  I know you didn't ask for a huge essay, but maybe something here will help.

TL/DR: you're experiencing what some have called "Fast play degradation".  Essentially:

- (a) the theory goes that your brain/nervous system can't organize the complex input it got during your practicing.  My recommendation:
- (b) Try to break up your long practicing of a given lick into shorter durations,
- (c) ensure that you can successfully execute something within that short session, and
- (d) be sure to end any given practice session of a lick with a perfect slow rendition of the thing you've practiced.

All right, that's a lot of stuff.  A few more notes for the above:

a) nervous system.  Some great piano documents talk about the primary role of the nervous system in piano playing, and having worked on it a bit for guitar I think it's the case.  Playing isn't about muscles, it's about your nervous system adapting, especially for "fast twitch" things like picking and fretting.  For improvement to happen, your practice sessions need to present a clear picture to your nervous system about what you're trying to do (I posted about this in [this link](https://forum.troygrady.com/t/your-practice-schedule-for-acquiring-new-motor-skills/42527) ).  If you're working at something quite beyond your current abilities, this input might be really chaotic and disorganized.  I'm not saying you need to aim lower :-) but you could try some adjustments.

Everything that follows is my suggestion only.  My tone may come across as an order or command, but please modify everything I say to suit you; however, if you're stuck, maybe trying something different is called for.

b) practice duration.  In that same thread I mentioned practicing something for about 15 mins, and then coming back to it later the same day.  This could be like "interleaved practice" as mentioned about, but you could also just take a break -- get some water, clean your room, walk the dog -- and come back to it.  This is a good method because it lets you really work hard on something and really pay attention, and the short duration and break gives your nervous system time to process.  Slaving away for hours at a lick is counterproductive: your nerves/brain are tire and won't adapt.  Practice anywhere from 5 to 15 mins, until you feel like you've accomplished something, but then stop and take that break!  Don't be "virtuous" and continue working, you might not be helping.  Come back to it later that day if you want to continue.  Also, during that 15 mins, take some micro breaks to think about what you're doing, what you've done, where you're going etc, it helps.

c) perfect execution.  This one is tougher ... you have to aim to play something perfectly within your 15 mins at least once, and ideally should play it perfectly a few times.  This gives your brain and nervous system something to latch on to, so it can adapt during your rest periods.

I said "play something perfectly" and not "play the lick perfectly", because often a single lick comprises several ideas.  Something as "simple" as this:

    --------------5-7-8-5-7-8-
    --5-6-8-5-6-8-------------

has these challenges:

- raw picking speed (tremelo)
- raw fretting speed (fretting only, no picking)
- fast picking of notes on a single string (e.g. "-5-6-8-") - hand sync issues, raw picking and fretting speed, relaxation, timing
- the goddam string change

If you're playing a lick and falling apart in the middle of it (ranging from a total train wreck to small-seeming things like rhythmic inconsistences, or simply acquired mental or physical tension), then you might want to break it down further into components and work on those.  e.g., there's no reason to work on the full lick above at a given speed if you can't pick the much simpler "-5-6-8-5-6-8-5-6-8-5-6-8-..." at a much higher speed with high rhythmic accuracy.

So, maybe analyze the full lick, see where your playing is falling apart, and see if that single issue can be isolated and worked on.  Some things (like the string shift) are hard to work on in isolation, but if you perfect the other tihngs (picking, left hand, rhythm) you can focus on those.  And play these little things perfectly :-)  Keep pushing that tempo way up!  Sloppy is ok while you're working it out!  But keep aiming for perfection of small bits, your brain will thank you.

(d) end with slow.  After 15 mins of intense work, your nerves will be frazzled and your mind tired.  It's gotten a lot of confusing input.  To ensure that it's clear what you've been working on, play that thing you've worked on through slowly at least once, mimicking the motions you do at high speed if you can -- i.e., don't play it slowly with a completely different technique (this can be tough, depending on what you're working on).  This is like the "cool down" of a workout, but it's more important for your nerves to help them organize.  I hope you'd get a feeling of satisfaction with this, it's supposed to be a fun relaxed wrap-up of your burst of hard work.
