I study piano for a time, and piano has a bunch of great literature on effective practice techniques and musicianship in general.  See the references for some of the sources I found interesting. While some are better than others, all of them offer interesting approaches to practicing.

For a guitar, and rock guitar in particular, the amount of information available is enormous.  There are several hundreds of teachers available on YouTube on websites, in guitar magazines etc. But, with few exceptions, most I did not find that most of them I did not find many of them offering the same practice tips as from piano teachers.  This book is a collection of what I consider to be the best tips from these teachers and sources, in some cases presented with no modification, and in others presented with specific adjustments for guitar.
