I study piano for a time, and piano has a bunch of great literature on effective practice techniques and musicianship in general (see :ref:`references`).

  

I did not find that most of them I did not find many of them offering the same practice tips as from piano teachers.  This book is a collection of what I consider to be the best tips from these teachers and sources, in some cases presented with no modification, and in others presented with specific adjustments for guitar.
