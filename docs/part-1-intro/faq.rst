*Note as of May 2021, during first draft: Nobody has actually asked me any questions yet, but if I saw something like this out in the wild, these are the questions that would likely pop into my skeptical head.  I'll update this with real questions should I ever get any frequent ones.  jz*

**Why should I listen to you?**

Good question, and that’s not what this book is about. This is not a collection of recommendations of things you should do during practicing. In my opinion, no one can really teach you how to play, they can just give suggestions and demonstrations. It’s up to you to work on those, and make them part of your physical and mental playing.

Instead of looking at these as recommendations, or even suggestions, look at them as a starting point for your own experiments and investigation. I would rather you think of these things as a conversation that you are having with yourself, rather or one that we are having together, rather than a one way flow of information.

**Which techniques should I use?**

See the technique ratings index to see the techniques in rating order. Maybe try the highest rated ones first, and see how they feel.

**My favourite technique is not listed here.**

Please let me know in the suggestions. I’ve tried to include things with a minimum of redundancy, but maybe I’ve missed some thing obvious I would be very interested to hear it!



**My teacher/favorite guitar instructor on YouTube/favorite player doesn’t use any of these techniques.**

I believe that these techniques are useful, but after some experimentation, you might not agree. That’s fine. These techniques are not a replacement for any existing practice routine you might follow. If you already have a successful routine, and you are happy with your progress, that’s fantastic.  But if you are not sure how to practice, if you can’t seem to define a and effective routine, or you are not making progress, the kind of progress you want, then maybe some of these ideas will help.

**I doubt that Eddie Van Halen/inveigh mom Steen/Sean Lane/Paul Gilbert used any of these techniques.**

Good point, and some or all of what is outlined here might feel overly analytical to some or to you.  I’ve been playing for a long time, but I am not I would not consider myself a natural. For the players mentioned above, they may have been they may be wired differently from the rest of us, and happened to find the secrets for their technique by instinct, rather than consciously. If your instinct leads you successfully, then you probably don’t need practice tips.  Unfortunately, instinct and enthusiasm can sometimes lead you astray, and you need to spend some time thinking about things.
