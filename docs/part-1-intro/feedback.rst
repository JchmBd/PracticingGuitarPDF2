.. todo:: final revision for feedback.rst

I'm very interested in your feedback and suggestions!

For the techniques, I’d be very happy to hear from you if anything really worked for you.  That would be extremely gratifying.

I’d also like to know if something in particular didn’t work for you.  Some of the material may require some “settling time” to come together within your body and mind; however, if you’ve given it an honest effort and it’s still not working, then likely the material needs further editing or clarification.

If you have any other practice techniques that you feel are effective, and are willing to share them, I’d be happy to consider them.  Note: I'm not really interested in picking exercises or drills, as those are already readily available, and this book is more about how to practice.

I’ve tried to write this with consistent information and tone, with few assumptions of your current situation, but errors can creep in.  Let me know if you spot anything.

I currently don’t have a schedule in mind for future revisions of this work, but I hope for this to be a long-lived, ongoing project.

Send error notices, suggestions or feedback in one of the following ways:

* via GitHub Issues: https://github.com/jzohrab/practicing-guitar/issues/new/choose (this project is stored in source code control)
* via email: you can reach me at jzohrab [at] gmail [dot] com.

Cheers and thank you!
