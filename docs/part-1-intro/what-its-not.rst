What It's Not

.. todo:: fill in content for what-its-not.rst


This book does not contain, or tries to avoid, any suggested practice licks or scales, or even or even scaler variations or arpeggios. There are loads of tutorials and licks on YouTube and on websites such as the following: give example here. So, i’m less interested in providing yet another list of lakes and scales for you to work on, and more on how you can practice those licks and scales to your best advantage.

In some cases, I will offer some well intentioned advice. I hope you consider it, but if it doesn’t suit you, no worriesl
