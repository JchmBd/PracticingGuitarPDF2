About this book
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This book is for guitarists.  It offers practical information that you can apply to make your practice sessions more productive, so that you can make better progress in less time than you would if you followed a more "natural, intuitive" method.

This is the book I wish I'd had when I first started practicing and playing more seriously.

Much of the information here comes from literature for piano.  Piano has hundreds of years of pedagogy and scientific investigation behind it, and a lot of that can be applied easily to guitar.  There are also some general practice tips, outlined in any number of books and web articles, which I've briefly to help you structure your approach.

This book does not contain, or tries to avoid, any suggested practice licks, scales, or what have you.  There are loads of tutorials and licks on YouTube and on websites already, and some of those are great.  I'm less interested in giving *yet-another-smokin'-hot-lick*, and more on how you can practice those licks and scales to your best advantage.  In some cases, I will offer some well intentioned advice. I hope you consider it, but if it doesnâ€™t suit you, no worriesl

Outline
^^^^^^^

"Part I - Intro" is this section.

"Part I - Basics" gives some basic thoughts that you might find interesting.  It outlines a theory of playing guitar as process of your nervous system, speed, and tension.  Fundamentally, technique is about ease in playing -- how at home you are at the instrument, and how practice and playing is about aligning your brain, nerves, and muscles to all work together fluidly.

"Part II - Setting up" is about getting organized, scheduling, etc.  How long should you practice?  How should you track things?  Some of this may be obvious to you.  Skip it if you don't need it.

"Part III - Techniques" is the most involved and interesting part.  It offers several practice techniques you can use to help you master techniques, licks, and songs more quickly and thoroughly.  The introduction to that section gives some pointers on how to use the techniques.

"Part IV - Miscellaneous" is, well, everything I wanted to add, but couldn't think of where to put it (e.g., improvisation and memorization).  There is a boatload of information out there about some of the items covered in this section, but I wanted to add a few points for your consideration.
