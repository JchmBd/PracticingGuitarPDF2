Speed
=====

- "Speed is very much an illusion. The human ear can take just so many sounds. If you play each note clearly, it will sound fast because the ear has to process a lot of information. If you play so fast that either you miss notes, or they become a blur, it doesn’t sound fast at all, it just sounds messy"

* "Speed is a function of movement. Speed walls are always a result of using a movement that has limitations. Rather than trying to break through the speed wall by persistent (and misguided) overpractice of the same movement, go around the speed wall by using a completely different movement." - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=5298.msg50376#msg50376

Lack of strength is hardly the problem in piano playing. Anyone who has enough strength to make it through the day has enough strength to play a Beethoven concerto.

The problem is co-contraction of antagonistic muscles, i.e. not releasing a muscle in time before an antagonistic muscle contracts. The antagonistic muscle then not only has to overcome the resistance of the keys, but also the resistance of its counterpart muscle. This is a waste of energy and will affect both muscles at the same time. The often used term "relaxation" in piano playing refers to releasing a muscle before its counterpart contracts. Learning to realease and contract in time is a matter of coordination, not a matter of strength. Antagonistic muscle action in piano playing occurs, e.g., in lifting and lowering a finger and in forearm rotation, to name only two examples.

This movement can only be figured out if someone shows you, or if you investigate speed playing by using the chord trick and – for the moment – ignoring accuracy and subtleties of touch. Once you figure out this movement, then yes, go ahead and investigate touch subtleties and accuracy by practising slowly the movement you figured out by speed practising.

speeding up as long as you are doing it in slow motion. This means that the movements that you perform slowly are exactly the same movements that you would perform at speed. However, if you just practise slowly using all kinds of inappropriate movements – movements you are getting away with simply because you are playing slowly- then incrementally speeding up will land you straight into a speed wall.

Speed is:

- a fast mind
- fast nervous system impulses to the right muscles
- no extraneous activity (other muscles)

For a "fast mind" - there are other considerations.  If you practice something slowly, your mind has time to make connections between neurons, different pathways, etc, that it can't make at high speed.  At high speed, your mind will simple "short-circuit" connections to get to where it needs to be.

"Speed Walls"

When it comes to learning how to play fast, the common advice of "start slow and gradually speed up" is, for the vast majority of people, false.  It is as useful as saying "To learn how to run, start walking slowly and gradually speed up."

An intuitive way to practice a passage would be to start the metronome at a slow speed, perfect the passage, and gradually increase the tempo until you reach the target or goal tempo.  For example, if you have a run of 16th notes at 170 bpm, you might start practicing at 50 bpm, nail it, bump up to 60 bpm, nail it, and so on.

Unfortunately, this method rarely works (footnote: if it did, there would be no secret at all to making progress, and we'd probably see many more proficient players than we do currently).  You will almost certainly hit a "speed wall", a tempo at which your movements carefully practiced at lower tempos are no longer viable.  There are two reasons why this speed wall happens:

* How you physically play is different at slower tempos and at higher tempos.  When playing slowly, your fingers aren't just moving more slowly:

  * you likely use different amounts of force production
  * you may engage different muscles in fretting and picking
  * you have more time to press and hold strings
  * the physical interaction between the fingertip and the fretted string is different

* How your brain processes things is different at slower tempos and at higher tempos.  When playing slowly, your mind isn't just thinking more slowly:

  * you have time to "think about every note"
  * the extra time between events (note changes) allow for different neurological connections to take place
  * the process to play a single note can actually travel through different regions of the brain and access different modalities


Playing fast is therefore:

* your body finding the right combination of movements, adjustments, and force necessary to play at speed.  You get this initially through trial-and-error.
* your brain streamlining the neurological pathways, avoiding the conscious processing centers of the brain (footnote: this is why you sometimes can't readily explain what you've just played when you play something fast -- you might have to stop and think.  Your conscious mind has to replay and analyze.)

Since slowing the metronome down introduces new conditions in our playing that we'll eventually have to correct, let's start with speed.  Play fast at first, experimenting and observing to find good approaches, and then slow down to refine what we've learned.

Then, once you have it roughly working at the top tempo, you slow it down.  But start from a target tempo and drop the metronome, and aim to play that.  Then chart how that tempo works.  eg if the top tempo is 175, try to play it at 175.  If you can't play it perfectly, drop the tempo again, and so on down until you reach the point where you play it perfectly.  Maybe today you had to drop it down to 130.  You play through it a few times at that tempo.  Then the next day, start at 175, and drop until you play it perfectly -- maybe it's 132 or 135.  And so on. (Note this is from Jason Sulliman)
