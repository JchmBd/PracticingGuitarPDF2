Tension and Relaxation

Bad term.  can't play totally relaxed.

No accumulated tension.

  If you keep your body relaxed, the body is in contact with the depths of your soul.  Is that clear?  Because it's quite important.  If you are stiff, in any joint, you impede the current, the emotion, physical current of what the music itself dictates to you.  If you have a stiff joint, you don't let it go through [into the instrument]. `Claudio Arrau, YouTube interview <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXOiLVT18W4&t=2m6s>`_

Our whole playing apparatus (and this includes not
only the arm and the muscles of the back but also the
feet in operating the pedals) must be absolutely free in
its movements and in its inner muscular functions.

But the normal muscle contraction is far from being a
cramp and is absolutely necessary for any motor activity.
A muscle is capable of any degree of contraction; the time
of this contraction varies from a fraction of a second to the
point where fatigue begins. For piano technique, the
short-lasting muscle contractions are of particular importance, And so we should talk, not about relaxation, but
rather about the degree of muscle contraction needed for
this or that motor act.

It is weak
static tension stimulating cortical activity that exerts the
most favorable influence on muscle preparedness and innervation.
