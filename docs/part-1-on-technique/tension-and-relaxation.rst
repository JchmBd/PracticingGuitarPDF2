Tension and Relaxation

Bad term.  can't play totally relaxed.

No accumulated tension.

  If you keep your body relaxed, the body is in contact with the depths of your soul.  Is that clear?  Because it's quite important.  If you are stiff, in any joint, you impede the current, the emotion, physical current of what the music itself dictates to you.  If you have a stiff joint, you don't let it go through [into the instrument]. `Claudio Arrau, YouTube interview <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXOiLVT18W4&t=2m6s>`_

Our whole playing apparatus (and this includes not
only the fingers, hands, and arms, but also the muscles of the back and torso) must be absolutely free in
its movements and in its inner muscular functions.

But the normal muscle contraction is far from being a
cramp and is absolutely necessary for any motor activity.
A muscle is capable of any degree of contraction; the time
of this contraction varies from a fraction of a second to the
point where fatigue begins. For piano technique, the
short-lasting muscle contractions are of particular importance, And so we should talk, not about relaxation, but
rather about the degree of muscle contraction needed for
this or that motor act.

"It frequently happens that even the pianist with some experience, as well as the beginner, is unable to achieve complete relaxation of his arms. When he wants his arm to fall down of its own weight, the extrapyramidal complex interferes instantly and prevents free fall. This physiological law of balancing our body and extremities in space is accomplished automatically by the cerebellum and is present constantly when the arm is in a horizontal position, as in piano playing. When the pupil’s attention is concentrated mainly on his finger activity, the amount of normal tension necessary for that balancing can be exceeded, resulting in muscle overexertion."

We all have a baseline level of tension -- and we need to get rid of it to allow the sub elements freer play.

Subc elements of the CNS have been trained to do certain things - balance, etc - but often these can be maladjusted.  Also, in some cases like mine, years of playing resulted in a mass of tension throughout my hands, wrists, and arms.  I'd thought that was necessary, and developed techniques which served in limited situations.  It was certainly inflexible.  My conditioned reflex when picking up the guitar was to immediately tense up -- I thought that was "readiness".

The problem is co-contraction of antagonistic muscles, i.e. not releasing a muscle in time before an antagonistic muscle contracts. The antagonistic muscle then not only has to overcome the resistance of the keys, but also the resistance of its counterpart muscle. This is a waste of energy and will affect both muscles at the same time. The often used term "relaxation" in piano playing refers to releasing a muscle before its counterpart contracts. Learning to realease and contract in time is a matter of coordination, not a matter of strength. Antagonistic muscle action in piano playing occurs, e.g., in lifting and lowering a finger and in forearm rotation, to name only two examples.



Tension and relaxation

Sources of tension

Tension comes from

Muscles not relaxing completely. When you play, muscles have to contract to move things. When you have reached your goal, though, the muscles have to relax completely. If they don’t, then the next time they contract, it will be with slightly less vigor. If you don’t relax completely then things will tire out.

Any movement is it involves antagonistic muscle groups. For example when you raise your hand, you are contracting your biceps biceps, and when you lower your hand you are relaxing your biceps, and potentially contracting your triceps. For repetitive cyclic motions, one muscle group poles one way, and then another pulls the other way. If your antagonistic muscle is not completely relaxed, then you are actually expending energy fighting against yourself to accomplish a first motion. So for fretting, you might be using the inside of your forearm to pull your fingers down, and then to raise them you will be using extensor muscles. If one or the other aren’t relaxed, You end up fighting yourself. This is a waste of energy.

Another source of tension is mental tension. When you are mentally tense, that can manifest as tension in other completely unrelated muscle groups. For example, you might be tensing your shoulders, or your neck, or your for head while playing. It’s a good idea to periodic to periodically scan your body for excess tension, and shake things out.

There is always some base level of tension when you play. Tension is actually a misleading term, because you might think that you have to be completely relaxed. But playing relaxed is just not possible, if you were relaxed completely you wouldn’t be able to lift your picking hand or threat any notes.

I prefer to think of that necessary energy for playing as activation, rather than tension.

So the danger is not tension, or preferably activation, but rather accumulated tension, if you have been playing for a long time, and you are not careful, or even if you’re a beginner, it’s easy to think of this tension as a necessary component for playing. By and large it is not useful.

If you play, and noticed tension building up, you really should stop immediately, and figure out what is going on. You can unfortunately start to rely on this tension to correct problems in your plan. Tension can be a sign of your body trying to somehow exert more control over what it’s doing. For example, if you are trying to pick a fast arpeggio, and have a lot of forearm tension, that can be because your body is trying to correct itself. That is not real technique, that is what Martin Miller calls "false technique."

I would not say that good technique is effortless. There will always be some effort to get the string through the pic get the pic through the string, to shift the fretting hand quickly to new positions, and just to play. However, when you are playing with correct technique, there is a sense of all of the effort going into going into the guitar and making the sound that you were trying to make. There isn’t a feeling of fighting against yourself.

There is of course a physical side to playing. Even though playing is governed by the central nervous system, your muscles still have to move things to actually play. So as you play, you are giving muscles a workout. But these are very extremely tiny muscles, very fine tuned. You should never have any extreme stress.

Mental stress can come from trying to do too much, tackling too many difficulties at once, or just fatigue. You can avoid this by such things as back training, and keeping your practice sessions for a particular thing short. Also, don’t forget to actually get up and stretch. And rest, and drink lots of water, all of the regular stuff you hear about.

This book is generally not about specific drills, but in the case of relaxation there are a few drills that I recommend for everyone.

Left hand relaxation: that video by Mercer whatever

Right hand relaxation: my video I guess

Full body relaxation: body scan, which is also mental relaxation

Tip: aim to associate picking up the guitar with a relaxation response.

Along with muscle cramps and problems, tension can also muddy the waters of the central nervous system. Since playing guitar requires very fine nerve impulses at precise times, tension in your system can actually block those impulses. This not only complicates or prevents smooth technique, it also stifles your creativity and expressive Ness. I’ll leave it to Claudio a row, one of the 20th century’s monster pianists, to explain this some more:
