Tension and Relaxation
----------------------

Bad term.  can't play totally relaxed.

No accumulated tension.

  If you keep your body relaxed, the body is in contact with the depths of your soul.  Is that clear?  Because it's quite important.  If you are stiff, in any joint, you impede the current, the emotion, physical current of what the music itself dictates to you.  If you have a stiff joint, you don't let it go through [into the instrument]. `Claudio Arrau, YouTube interview <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXOiLVT18W4&t=2m6s>`_

Our whole playing apparatus (and this includes not
only the arm and the muscles of the back but also the
feet in operating the pedals) must be absolutely free in
its movements and in its inner muscular functions.

But the normal muscle contraction is far from being a
cramp and is absolutely necessary for any motor activity.
A muscle is capable of any degree of contraction; the time
of this contraction varies from a fraction of a second to the
point where fatigue begins. For piano technique, the
short-lasting muscle contractions are of particular importance, And so we should talk, not about relaxation, but
rather about the degree of muscle contraction needed for
this or that motor act.

It is weak
static tension stimulating cortical activity that exerts the
most favorable influence on muscle preparedness and innervation.

"It frequently happens that even the pianist with some experience, as well as the beginner, is unable to achieve complete relaxation of his arms. When he wants his arm to fall down of its own weight, the extrapyramidal complex interferes instantly and prevents free fall. This physiological law of balancing our body and extremities in space is accomplished automatically by the cerebellum and is present constantly when the arm is in a horizontal position, as in piano playing. When the pupilâ€™s attention is concentrated mainly on his finger activity, the amount of normal tension necessary for that balancing can be exceeded, resulting in muscle overexertion."

We all have a baseline level of tension -- and we need to get rid of it to allow the sub elements freer play.

Subc elements of the CNS have been trained to do certain things - balance, etc - but often these can be maladjusted.  Also, in some cases like mine, years of playing resulted in a mass of tension throughout my hands, wrists, and arms.  I'd thought that was necessary, and developed techniques which served in limited situations.  It was certainly inflexible.  My conditioned reflex when picking up the guitar was to immediately tense up -- I thought that was "readiness".

The problem is co-contraction of antagonistic muscles, i.e. not releasing a muscle in time before an antagonistic muscle contracts. The antagonistic muscle then not only has to overcome the resistance of the keys, but also the resistance of its counterpart muscle. This is a waste of energy and will affect both muscles at the same time. The often used term "relaxation" in piano playing refers to releasing a muscle before its counterpart contracts. Learning to realease and contract in time is a matter of coordination, not a matter of strength. Antagonistic muscle action in piano playing occurs, e.g., in lifting and lowering a finger and in forearm rotation, to name only two examples.
