A Better Practice Routine

Play, and evaluate: "We should point out that pupils are often inclined to repeat a passage in fast succession, starting the next repetition when the preceding one is hardly finished. In correct practicing, a slight pause (several seconds) must be inserted between repetitions, to give the pianist time to check whether everything just performed was correct and the results were musically satisfactory, and to prepare himself mentally for the next repetition. Conscious effort can help in organizing the process of practicing, and so facilitate the work and shorten the time needed for achieving the goal. But comprehension cannot replace necessary practicing. The necessary number of repetitions and length of period needed for assimilation of a new combination of movements depend on several circumstances. The most important are: (1) the complexity of a given motor form; (2) the type of nervous system of a given individual; (3) the concentration of his attention; (4) the previously established connections." 

Rest is key: "Sometimes excessive industry and strenuous practicing can result in failure. The more persistently one tries, the worse the results, Fatigue of the central nervous system, which is not noticed by the player, is the reason for this failure. When in despair he abandons his efforts and later resumes his work, he notices that many, if not all, obstacles are miraculously gone. Fatigue is alleviated by rest. With a fresh start, the results of previous practicing show themselves clearly." 

Pay close attention to tone!  Different pick angles, hand positions, speed of attack, pick depth, all play a role in tone.  These will challenge the nervous system, and increase engagement with the playing.

Starting: "In the initial period of study, the pupil should concentrate on tone production, starting from single, separate tones, with attention on tone quality, proprioceptive sensations and form of movement, all three closely united."
