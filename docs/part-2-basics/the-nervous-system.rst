** Central nervous sys

Kochevitsky: "When forced to new multiform adjustments, the motor activity of those lower divisions is overburdened with unnecessary concomitant movements and muscle overtensions. And often at first it does not accomplish a given task expeditiously. Externally this is expressed in awkwardness and clumsiness. But gradually the cortex learns to master the subordinated mechanisms, to reorganize their work. It adds purposefulness to motor acts: regulated by the highest centers, motor activity now becomes “thinkingly directed,” skillful and graceful in appearance, and also more flexible. As a consequence, muscles have to perform their activity in somewhat different ways. Their contractions arise rapidly, last a very short time, and constantly interchange with relaxations. The motor apparatus now has much more to do. It seems to serve more masters now, to serve many new incoming demands."

Conscious mind sets the direction, and tries some clumsy method.  Then you have to get out of the conscious mind, to push the techniue along so the subconscious processes take over.  You were never really in control anyway: the sub was making scores of adjustments as you played.  So perhap playing fast, really fast, while still keping the necessary relaxation in place so as to not introduce new conflicting information to the CNS (cent nerv syst), is the best way to take the routine out of the domain of the conscious mind, and to hand the keys to the sub.

Optionally, distract the con mind with something -- watching TV.  But keep in mind that it's a good idea to direct the consc mind to the playing very frequently, to monitor and observe.  It's easy to pick up bad technique unnoticed.

Play in bursts, to get the benefit of both.  The con mind needs to establish the goal, organize the rough sequence of movements, and start the process.  The sub then takes over to deliver, with the con mind evaluating, and perhaps jumping in to adjust as you go.  Then the sub stops, and cons mind evaluates again.  The consc mind can also help push you along -- faster, faster, easier, easier.

"It frequently happens that even the pianist with some experience, as well as the beginner, is unable to achieve complete relaxation of his arms. When he wants his arm to fall down of its own weight, the extrapyramidal complex interferes instantly and prevents free fall. This physiological law of balancing our body and extremities in space is accomplished automatically by the cerebellum and is present constantly when the arm is in a horizontal position, as in piano playing. When the pupil’s attention is concentrated mainly on his finger activity, the amount of normal tension necessary for that balancing can be exceeded, resulting in muscle overexertion."

Subc elements of the CNS have been trained to do certain things - balance, etc - but often these can be maladjusted.  Also, in some cases like mine, years of playing resulted in a mass of tension throughout my hands, wrists, and arms.  I'd thought that was necessary, and developed techniques which served in limited situations.  It was certainly inflexible.  My conditioned reflex when picking up the guitar was to immediately tense up -- I thought that was "readiness".

"Careful control over sensations arising during movements (though not the detailed control dreamed of by the anatomic-physiological school) helps to exclude unnecessary exertions. If the higher centers do not prevail, the lower ones act independently, and the organized coordination is disarranged, the precision and smooth velocity of movement are disturbed."

We all have a baseline level of tension -- and we need to get rid of it to allow the sub elements freer play.

** physiology - nerve impulses

"The entire route traveled by the nerve impulse from peripheral receptor through the transmitting afferent nerve fibers to the brain, and outward through efferent nerve fibers extending to certain executive organs, is called the reflex arc. Training establishes a conditioned reflex arc by repeatedly connecting any given sensory stimulation with a particular motor activity."

** Inhibition vs excitation

"When a stimulus creates excitation, the result is a discharge of impulses. Inhibition suppresses superfluous (or even harmful) excitation ... Since fast, even piano playing is the result of precise balance between these two basic processes of nervous activity, both processes require special training, particularly the inhibitory."

When you play, your subconscious is sending impulses to muscles to contract.  Just as important as the contraction is the relaxation when the required movement is complete, so the muscle is ready for the next impules.  If there's any residual tension, the next signal is lost ... things tense up.

"Contrary to what one might think, training the weaker inhibitory process which regulates movement is more important for the development of speed (and more difficult for the cortex) than training excitation."

FH practicing: Try raising the fingers slightly before bringing them down, for legato practice.

"In the central nervous system, reciprocal relations exist between flexors (bending muscles) and extensors (straightening muscles). The intense excitation of flexors will call forth intense inhibition of extensors, and vice versa. Since the inhibitory process is weaker than the process of excitation, a slight raising of fingers (intense excitation of extensors) before their descent into the keys appears to be a valuable means for strengthening weak inhibition of flexors."

Interest is key: create your own exercises based on your own tunes, licks, and techniques:

"Pavlov’s followers tell us about a hypothetical focusing, orienting, investigating reflex which implies the condition of motivation and seems to be related to evoking a state of alertness or attentiveness in the central nervous system. Called the reflex of purpose, it does not culminate in a definite external reaction. But elicited and strengthened by some circumstance (in our case, a strong desire directed toward realizing a vivid musical image on the piano), it expresses itself in functional change and increased excitability of the whole nervous system (a state of raised emotions, enthusiasm). The result is heightened activity of definite relevant nervous elements while other points of the central nervous system, due to the law of reciprocal induction, are in a greater or lesser degree inhibited."

"The process of coupling two nervous points, of laying a new neural path, cannot take place if we are in a state of fatigue or drowsiness or if our mind is not free from irrelevant activity."


Since every movement is initiated in the central nervous system, practicing is, first and foremost, a psychic process, the working over of accumulated bodily experiences and the adjustment to a definite purpose. ... The kind, degree and dimension of this adjustment are always regulated by the central nervous system. ... We do not know which group of muscles participates in this or that movement. Even if we did, this knowledge would not help us since we cannot command our muscles consciously and directly. The choice of necessary muscles takes place unconsciously, but nonetheless surely, and accomplishes the exclusion of all unsuitable interfering muscles. Beginning practice starts with too much expenditure of force. The elimination of too much muscle action is the real basis for developing agility. As a result of practicing, we learn to make the fluent, sure and fast movement which uses exactly as much muscle force as is needed for a given purpose. -- Steinhausen

"Practicing at the piano is mainly practicing of the central nervous system, whether we are aware of it or not. Misconceptions of the past have led to inefficient practicing, unproductive expenditure of time, and often deplorable results." - kochevitsky

"Schumann believed that the ability to listen to oneself was most important to a musician-performer. He suggested that the pianist first mentally perceive the essence of a composition instead of digging and hacking “away at it, bar by bar.” He wrote: “Do not play the musical composition before you can hear it inwardly.” “The finger must do what the head wills, not vice versa.””

The above follows the suggestion that people record themselves and listen.  Also, take time between each rep.  This may give the nervous system chance to regulate and organize itself.

nervous system.  Some great piano documents talk about the primary role of the nervous system in piano playing, and having worked on it a bit for guitar I think it's the case.  Playing isn't about muscles, it's about your nervous system adapting, especially for "fast twitch" things like picking and fretting.  For improvement to happen, your practice sessions need to present a clear picture to your nervous system about what you're trying to do (I posted about this in [this link](https://forum.troygrady.com/t/your-practice-schedule-for-acquiring-new-motor-skills/42527) ).  If you're working at something quite beyond your current abilities, this input might be really chaotic and disorganized.  I'm not saying you need to aim lower :-) but you could try some adjustments.
