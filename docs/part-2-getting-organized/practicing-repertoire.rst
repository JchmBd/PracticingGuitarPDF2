Practicing Repertoire
---------------------

Playing pieces (songs, solos, etc) is fun, but it's extremely easy to play through a piece and gloss over tough passages!

For practicing passages in repertoire, the 20 minute rule is still in effect, but the important aspect is this: you should have a passage **perfect** at the end of that 20 minutes.

If it is taking more than that, then the passage you chose to work on is too big, or contains too many challenges to be tackled in 20 minutes.

If those challenges are fundamental motor skill challenges, isolate those.

If the challenges are musical or technical, cut the passage in half and work on that, making it **perfect** within the 20 minutes.  Continue cutting in half if necessary!  Provided there aren't any fundamental motor skill challenges, anyone can take any passage, and boil it down to even two notes, perfect them, and build from there.

Most people select bits that are bigger than they can chew. This leads to endlessly practising for hours on end without visible improvement, which leads to fatigue and discouragement. Don't do that, do the clever thing and make the passage smaller.

The next day when you come to practice, you should repeat the above process with the *same passage*.  Depending on the difficulty, you may need to repeat the above process, even for a few days.  But you will make progress on this section, and in doing so will acquire the tools you need to surmount the next obstacle.

The best explanation I've found yet about this comes from pianostreet.com:

  In order to learn anything in the most efficient way, work on it with full concentration for a period of time (15 – 20 minutes is more then enough) and then forget about it until the next day. The next day repeat the same procedure for the same amount of time and again forget it until the next day. Repeat this as many days as necessary to be able to play the passage in question is such a way that you cannot get it wrong even if you try. I assure you that you will get to this point in a maximum of seven days, usually much less. This demands incredible discipline and consistency. But it works like magic.

  Now consider this extreme example. You decide to practise 5 hours every day. These five hours can be divided in  12 practise sessions of 20 minutes each plus 5 minutes break in between each practice session.  The worst thing you can do is this: “Today I am going to practise bars 12- 24 of piece x.”. Then you do that in each of the 12 practice sessions. For 5 hours solid. It does not work. It is a waste of time.  The brilliant thing you can do is to use each of these 12 practice sessions to practise something completely different in each.

  You see, it does not matter if you work on a passage for 20 minutes or for five hours. Whatever you accomplished in 20 minutes is all you are going to accomplish that day. You need a night’s sleep in between. It is far better to work twelve days for 20 minutes everyday in a passage than to work on that passage for 12 consecutive sessions in a day. (You do not need to believe me. Just try it out!). Instead use the other eleven daily sessions to learn eleven new things. At the end of a week you will be amazed at the fantastic amount that you have learned.

  But you must have a plan. You must make sure that everything that you are practising in these sessions add up to something at the end of a week.

  This also means that you do not need to practise 10 –12 hours a day. 20 minutes is plenty. But the amount you will be able to learn in 20 minutes will be 1/12 of what you could learn in 5 hours. Do you understand what I am getting at? Do not think in terms of hours of practise per day, but in terms of number of 20 minute sessions per day and stick to whatever you are doing for seven days (or until you master it - usually less than seven days).  `bernhard, pianostreet.com <https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=3039.msg26535#msg26535>`__


And regarding perfecting the passage, once again I'll refer to the same great teacher:

   Use a timer. Also, there is a law of diminishing returns. As you practise a section you start by making lots of mistakes and learning form your mistakes. This is the exploratory phase. After a while you figure out all the co-ordinates and you pay it perfectly. A lot of beginners stop practising at this point. This is actually the point where real practice starts: when you finally got it right. Up to now most of your practice will have consisted of wrong repetitions. Now you must ingrain the correct section by repeating it at least as many times as you did it wrong in the exploratory phase. However, after a while of repeating perfect renditions of your passage, due to fatigue (both mental and physical) you will start making mistakes again. It is very important that you stop practising before getting to this stage. You must stop when your repeats are perfect. But being human, your reaction when you start making mistakes again is to keep repeating to try to re-achieve your former perfection. You will not be able to. In fact all you will achieve is several hours of wrong repetitions. Next day, of course the whole section is a mess even though you may have practised it for five hours. So make sure that your last repeat is always perfect: this is what will be ingrained in your brain.  `bernhard, pianostreet.com <https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php/topic,4689.msg44184.html#msg44184>`__
