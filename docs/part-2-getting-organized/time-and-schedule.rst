Practice Time and Schedule
==========================

As covered in :ref:`part-1-on-technique`, playing guitar is a nervous system activity, and any improvement will happen during rest periods while the nervous system adapts to the new stresses placed upon it.  So, we need *clearly* indicate what we want to improve to the brain and nervous system, and then step back and let the brain and body sort things out for us.  A good schedule will ensure that we're not wasting time.

The ideal practice schedule:

1. Practice hard for 20 minutes.
2. Take a short break, noting any observations.  Shake things out, stretch.
3. Go back to step 1, and work on *something different*.  You can repeat 20-minute chunks, but they should be spaced out during the day (see :ref:`repeating_chunks` below).

.. note:: Practice as long as you want to, but be sure to break it into these 20-minute chunks.  This is key.

Why 20 minutes?
---------------

* Playing is mostly a mental activity, and so you need to ensure your mind and body are at peak concentration.
* There is a physical component to playing, so rest is essential for smaller muscles.
* You need to reflect on the work you've done in those 20 minutes.

If you've done focused work during your 20 minutes, that's sufficient for your brain and nervous system to process and adapt during your rest period.

.. tip:: Get a timer, set it to 20 minutes, and at the end of 20 minutes, stop!

Using 20 minutes
----------------

Practicing can be broken down into two massively broad categories:

1. Motor skills: picking technique, fretting technique, chord shifts, arpeggios ... pure technique, the nuts and bolts of playing.
2. Repertoire: new songs, chord progressions, studies, licks, improvisation, solos ... your real playing.

Each of those use the 20-minute rule differently.

Motor skills
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Acquisition**

If you're working on a brand new motion, such as trying to increase your picking speed, 20 minutes is long enough (maybe too long!) for you to experiment, and ensure that you're not accidentally engaging any extra muscles that shouldn't be involved.  It can take a while for your nervous system to establish and refine the optimum signals and pathways.  You can work hard for 20 minutes, but any longer than that will likely be wasted effort.

**Refinement**

If you are refining an existing motion, such as picking a difficult lick, you can spend 20 minutes on that single motion, or you can try interleaving practice -- that is, work on that motion for a few minutes, and then switch to a *completely different motion* and work on that for a few minutes, then back and forth.  Within a given 20-minute chunk, I'd suggest interleaving maximum four items, because that way you get 2 reps of 2 minutes per item, plus another few minutes for some quick experiments.

I suggest doing a completely different motion because it's easy to accidentally work on the same technique within practice sessions, and overtire your nerves.  For example, if you're working on one difficult lick, and then working on arpeggios, both of those might be pushing your picking skills to the limit, which might be hard to manage.  So, instead of picking everything, you could try fretting-hand-only legato technique, or chord shifts, etc.  (Note: like everything I've presented here and elsewhere, it's up to you!)

With either concentrated or interleaved practice, be on the lookout for fatigue, either physical or mental.  Those will lead to "false technique" -- your body recruiting extraneous muscles and motions to accomplish the task, which, while giving you the illusion of progress, are actually harmful and will need to be undone!

Repertoire
^^^^^^^^^^

For repertoire, it's easy to play through a piece and gloss over tough sections.  When practicing repertoire, I'm referring to working through those difficult sections or measures of a piece (lick, solo, song, etc), or just going measure-by-measure through a whole song.

The 20 minute rule holds here as well, but the important aspect is that you should have a passage **perfect** at the end of that 20 minutes.  If it is taking more than that, then the passage you chose to work on is too big, or contains too many challenges to be tackled in 20 minutes.

If those challenges are fundamental motor skill challenges, isolate those.

If the challenges are musical or technical, cut the passage in half and work on that, making it **perfect** within the 20 minutes.  Continue cutting in half if necessary!  Provided there aren't any fundamental motor skill challenges, anyone can take any passage, and boil it down to even two notes, perfect them, and build from there.

Most people select bits that are bigger than they can chew. This leads to endlessly practising for hours on end without visible improvement, which leads to fatigue and discouragement. Don't do that, do the clever thing and make the passage smaller.

The next day when you come to practice, you should repeat the above process with the same passage.  Depending on the difficulty, you may need to repeat the above process, even for a few days.  But you will make progress on this section, and in doing so will acquire the tools you need to surmount the next obstacle.

The best explanation I've found yet about this comes from pianostreet.com:

  In order to learn anything in the most efficient way, work on it with full concentration for a period of time (15 – 20 minutes is more then enough) and then forget about it until the next day. The next day repeat the same procedure for the same amount of time and again forget it until the next day. Repeat this as many days as necessary to be able to play the passage in question is such a way that you cannot get it wrong even if you try. I assure you that you will get to this point in a maximum of seven days, usually much less. This demands incredible discipline and consistency. But it works like magic.

  Now consider this extreme example. You decide to practise 5 hours every day. These five hours can be divided in  12 practise sessions of 20 minutes each plus 5 minutes break in between each practice session.  The worst thing you can do is this: “Today I am going to practise bars 12- 24 of piece x.”. Then you do that in each of the 12 practice sessions. For 5 hours solid. It does not work. It is a waste of time.  The brilliant thing you can do is to use each of these 12 practice sessions to practise something completely different in each.

  You see, it does not matter if you work on a passage for 20 minutes or for five hours. Whatever you accomplished in 20 minutes is all you are going to accomplish that day. You need a night’s sleep in between. It is far better to work twelve days for 20 minutes everyday in a passage than to work on that passage for 12 consecutive sessions in a day. (You do not need to believe me. Just try it out!). Instead use the other eleven daily sessions to learn eleven new things. At the end of a week you will be amazed at the fantastic amount that you have learned.

  But you must have a plan. You must make sure that everything that you are practising in these sessions add up to something at the end of a week.

  This also means that you do not need to practise 10 –12 hours a day. 20 minutes is plenty. But the amount you will be able to learn in 20 minutes will be 1/12 of what you could learn in 5 hours. Do you understand what I am getting at? Do not think in terms of hours of practise per day, but in terms of number of 20 minute sessions per day and stick to whatever you are doing for seven days (or until you master it - usually less than seven days).  `bernhard, pianostreet.com <https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=3039.msg26535#msg26535>`__


And regarding perfecting the passage, once again I'll refer to the same great teacher:

   Use a timer. Also, there is a law of diminishing returns. As you practise a section you start by making lots of mistakes and learning form your mistakes. This is the exploratory phase. After a while you figure out all the co-ordinates and you pay it perfectly. A lot of beginners stop practising at this point. This is actually the point where real practice starts: when you finally got it right. Up to now most of your practice will have consisted of wrong repetitions. Now you must ingrain the correct section by repeating it at least as many times as you did it wrong in the exploratory phase. However, after a while of repeating perfect renditions of your passage, due to fatigue (both mental and physical) you will start making mistakes again. It is very important that you stop practising before getting to this stage. You must stop when your repeats are perfect. But being human, your reaction when you start making mistakes again is to keep repeating to try to re-achieve your former perfection. You will not be able to. In fact all you will achieve is several hours of wrong repetitions. Next day, of course the whole section is a mess even though you may have practised it for five hours. So make sure that your last repeat is always perfect: this is what will be ingrained in your brain.  `bernhard, pianostreet.com <https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php/topic,4689.msg44184.html#msg44184>`__


Rest
----

When you're done the 20 minutes, take a short break.  Stretch, relax, make notes.  Your mind, nerves, and muscles need to take a moment to refresh.

.. _repeating_chunks:

Repeating 20-minute chunks
--------------------------

For motor skill aquisition, it's very good to do short bursts of practice a few times a day.  Do a short practice session, take a break for an hour or so, and then repeat that same session.  Do that a few times.

The rest period allows your body to make some quick adjustments.  Don't expect to see improvement within the same day, but after a longer rest, things might come together.  Especially with interleaved practice (of a few items), you can cover a lot of ground.

Day-to-day Schedule
-------------------

If your daily practicing is going well, you will soon get a feel for what kind of schedule you'll need to keep.

Sometimes things need some "baking time" to set.  I've found that if I practice a given technique very hard for a few days, I can take a day or so break from it, and work on something else.  And some pieces of repertoire need to seep into the unconscious.

With that said, it's much better to work on something bit by bit over several days, rather than cram one long session.  The repeated exposure and rest is what causes your brain to grow.
