Keep a Practice Journal
-----------------------

Many, if not all, teachers suggest keeping a practice journal.  There are dozens of blog posts etc out there about keeping a practice journal, you may have seen some already.  If not, no sweat, here is a suggestions to get started, and you can follow up with more detailed reading later.

.. tip:: Start with something extremely simple, and refine your system later. [#]_

By "extremely simple", I mean something like this:

* have a piece of paper or small notebook in your practice area
* write today's date at the top of the page
* list the things you'll work on, with some quick tab as reference if needed
* (do your practicing)
* for each thing you worked on, write down the time spent, what you tried, how it sounded and felt, and ideas for next time

At the next session -- next day, or later in the same day depending on your scheduling, continue the same process, same notebook or paper.  You might find that keeping a practice journal encourages you to do some solid reflecting, or helps you articulate your thoughts.  It will also be a good record of what you've tried.

What gets measured gets improved.

Different people have different journaling systems [#]_, and you can buy practice journals [#]_ if you're so inclined.  But if you're starting out with this idea, it can be overwhelming and paralyzing.  So start small, and refine ... let your system guide you, don't be a slave to it.
