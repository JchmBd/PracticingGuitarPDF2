A Practice Journal
------------------

There are dozens of blog posts etc out there about keeping a practice journal, you may have read them already.  If not, no sweat, here are some suggestions to get started.

Start with something extremely simple, and refine your system from there.

By extremely simple, I mean just have a piece of paper next to your guitar, write today's date, and put the few things you're working on.  Say 2 or 3 things, each of them 20 mins long, so that's an hour.  If you're working on new motor skill acquisition, you might be spending even less time on that, but you'll have several of those throughout the day.  Repertoire, 1 section, and then a new motor skill, and then more repertoire, or improv skills.

So, on your paper:

date
write the thing down.
write some quick tab
write what you're going to do
do it
then, write what you did, how it went, what your feeling is, what you'll do next time.

Next session, continue same process, same piece of paper.

Different people have different journaling systems, and they write about chords, arpeggios, scales, etc.  But if you're starting out with this idea, it can be overwhelming and paralyzing.  So start small, and refine ... let your system guide you, don't be a slave to it.

Here are some admittedly very rough practice journal entries from me, when I worked on some new technique.  I used a simple text document on my computer as well for other items, but I actually prefer the hard copy in many ways.

For each lick, track the maximum tempo you hit, how good it felt, etc.  Continuously measuring things will help.
