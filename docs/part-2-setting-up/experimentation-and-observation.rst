Experimentation And Observation
-------------------------------

Learning a new technique can be challenging, even if you have a good teacher.  It's not challenging because the technique itself is challenging: most techniques are, I believe, quite simple once you've got them.  But it's very easy to approach technique with the wrong idea, and your conscious mind can get in the way of an efficient technique.

For example, if you're trying to alternate pick really quickly, you (i.e. your conscious mind) might think you need to expend a lot of effort, because you're moving really fast and changing directions frequently.  But that's not the case.

Ideally, you'd look at good players and try to model what they're doing.  There are often many different ways to accomplish the same technique.  For example, some players use wrist, some elbows, some fingers, etc.  In short, there's usually no one single way to play one thing.  What that means is that you need to keep trying to find different ways to do it, keep testing the waters.

Move hand position, how you hold your pick, float your hand, float your wrist.

Have to give a good honest effort.  You might not find the answer within a few minutes.  You have to keep track of what is going on, what you've tried, and what you've observed in your results.  Sometimes it will be obvious, and sometimes not.  You might even want to keep a practice journal to keep track of what you've done.

Usually when it comes to new techniques, or even trying using your techniques in unfamiliar settings, the best thing you can do is practice hard for a short period of time, and then move on.  This

Keep trying and experimenting.  Experiment and observe.  And be honest in your observations!  If you crank up your distortion/reverb/effects etc., it might sound more interesting, but it may be hiding some problems.  So be honest about your accuracy, timing, and tone, and use that as feedback for the next round of experimentation.

Try out a technique, give it a good honest attempt, and see what works and doesn't work.

To see if a given practice technique works for you, the best thing you can do is put it to the test: take two similar passages or licks, and learn one lick without the practice technique, and the other with it.  Give the practice technique a good solid effort.  Do this for a few practice sessions, and record the results.  And see which way works better for you.

Always be experimenting, always be loose, and always be open to trying something different.
