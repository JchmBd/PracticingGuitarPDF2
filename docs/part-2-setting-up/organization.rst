Organization
------------

The information laid out in :ref:`time_and_schedule` may feel overwhelming at first glance, but it's actually quite easy to put into practice.  Here are some thoughts to help you get started:

* start a :ref:`practice journal <practice_journal>`, even just a sheet of paper.
* plan your practice for the day
* work your plan

The discipline of practice is less about sitting down to grind out reps for hours -- though that's sometimes fun -- and more about planning an effective routine, and following through on it.  This requires thought and organization.

For me, the discipline during practicing actually consists of knowing when to stop: after the 20-minute timer has gone off, I occasionally continue to fruitlessly and mindlessly hammer through a given lick, ignoring the signs that I'm making zero progress and not paying attention.
