Now let me say a few more words about 15 - 20 minutes, so that it is perfectly clear what I mean.

The important aspect is that you should have a passage perfect at the end of 15 â€“ 20 minutes.

If it is taking more than that, then the passage you chose to work on is too big.

Cut it in half.

Most people select bits that are bigger than they can chew. This leads to practising for hours on end without visible improvement, which leads to fatigue, discouragement and actually burn out in relation to the passage/piece in question.

Here is another approach to be combined with the 15-20 minutes one. I probably already said that in one of the threads, but I cannot remember where.

It takes 7 repetitions for the human brain to learn anything. So, choose a passage and repeat it seven times. If after seven times you have not learnt it, it is because it is too large a chunk of information.

TODO 7 by 20, starting at This has the following awesome practical consequence:

So instead of doing what everyone who does not know this piece of information do, namely keep repeating endlessly the passage hundreds of times, do the clever thing and make the passage smaller.

* "Yes. You must avoid this. Use a timer. Also, there is a law of diminishing returns. As you practise a section you start by making lots of mistakes and learning form your mistakes. This is the exploratory phase. After a while you figure out all the co-ordinates and you pay it perfectly. A lot of beginners stop practising at this point. This is actually the point where real practice starts: when you finally got it right. Up to now most of your practice will have consisted of wrong repetitions. Now you must ingrain the correct section by repeating it at least as many times as you did it wrong in the exploratory phase. However, after a while of repeating perfect renditions of your passage, due to fatigue (both mental and physical) you will start making mistakes again. It is very important that you stop practising before getting to this stage. You must stop when your repeats are perfect. But being human, your reaction when you start making mistakes again is to keep repeating to try to re-achieve your former perfection. You will not be able to. In fact all you will achieve is several hours of wrong repetitions. Next day, of course the whole section is a mess even though you may have practised it for five hours. So make sure that your last repeat is always perfect: this is what will be ingrained in your brain." - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php/topic,4689.msg44184.html#msg44184

* "Speed is a function of movement. Speed walls are always a result of using a movement that has limitations. Rather than trying to break through the speed wall by persistent (and misguided) overpractice of the same movement, go around the speed wall by using a completely different movement." - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=5298.msg50376#msg50376


* Time to spend practicing (https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=3039.msg26757#msg26757, 15-20 mins, 7x) -- "At this point comes the 20 minute principle. Do not play this first bar anymore today! Nothing bad will happen if in your next 20 minute practice session you work on this first bar again. But nothing good will happen either: It will be a total waste of time. Instead take your break, and on the next session work on a different passage of the prelude."
