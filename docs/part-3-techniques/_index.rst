.. todo:: Fix part intro

There’s a fair amount of material here, so take it bit by bit. You don’t need to read this thing from start to finish, take whatever sections interest you or seem applicable, and use them.

- Yes, practice tricks, hands separate, etc. are done for a very limited time only for the purpose of thoroughly learning and ingraining the movements. Once you get that, you simply play and enjoy the piece. Practising is a temporary process to be get rid of as soon as possible.  - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php/topic,3561.msg31700.html#msg31700

- "The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Just give it a try. But not a half-hearted try. Give it all you get. Do not dismiss it straight away."

- But above all, do not get lost in thought: try it out! All these methods are powerful, but they all have limitations and situations where they will fall apart. The only way to find out is trying them out.

- "Method" - "It is more like a set of principles that have to be investigated and adapted to each person's idiossincracies. Try it out, keep what works, discard what does not. And sometimes go back to something you discarded, you may understand it better now and derive some benefit from it." - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=4851.msg85705#msg85705

- test it out: "Pick two pieces of similar difficulty/style. One of them you learn exactly the way you would have you had never heard of these maps. The other one you learn by following (the best you can) the instructions given. In a couple of week’s time (or more, or less), compare results and tell us." - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=5083.msg48306#msg48306

To see if a given practice technique works for you, the best thing you can do is put it to the test: take two similar passages or licks, and learn one lick without the practice technique, and the other with it.  Give the practice technique a good solid effort.  Do this for a few practice sessions, and record the results.  And see which way works better for you.


Here are a bunch of practice techniques and variations you can try. For you to try. You don’t need to use them all, find the ones that you like and that are effective for you.

Some techniques take a while to come together. So, if if you try one, be sure to give it a good effort. Give it all you’ve got, with full concentration, and spend some time with it. Say, a week where you spend at least a few minutes each day using one technique.

Sometimes, one technique might not make sense right away, but might make sense later. So revisit. There’s no rush, this is not stuff that you need to get through. These are all just suggestions for your experiments.

I’ve added or assigned arbitrary ratings for each technique, based on how useful I think they might be to a newcomer. All of them are useful in some respect. But check out this index

Lastly, don’t get hung up on these techniques! These are training wheels for you to get comfortable with your playing material and your music and your technique and your real technique as quickly as possible once a tech once once a practice technique has given you results for one piece, start performing that passage. Playing and performing with full control is the best practice you can have. Or is it? I don’t really know. Anyway suffice it to say, don’t just play with these techniques just have fun with them mess round Mess around make mistakes clean things up learn from them.
