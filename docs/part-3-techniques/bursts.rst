   Play parts of a passage at half speed, and parts at full speed.

Playing a short section of a lick at half speed (a.k.a. half time) can let your brain "lock in" to the rhythm that the lick should fit into.  For example, if you play the following 2-beat lick for several beats, your mind can quickly wander, muscles tire, and you lose accuracy:

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true
   notes =|: :16 6-8-6-5/2 6-8-6-5/2 =:|

Playing a short section of the lick at half speed can let you really feel the beat, and a clear beat helps your body "fit the playing to the time alloted", if that makes sense.  The slower portion also gives your nervous system a chance to relax and prepare for the next attempt.

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true
   notes =|: :q 6-8-6-5/2 | :16 6-8-6-5/2 6-8-6-5/2 :h 6/2 =:|

For sextuplet licks, try playing parts of the lick in slower triples:

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true time=12/8
   notes :16 =|: 8-5-7-8-7-5/1 8-5-7-8-7-5/1 =:|

And with bursts:

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true time=12/8
   notes =|: :8 8-5-7-8-7-5/1 :16 8-5-7-8-7-5/1 8-5-7-8-7-5/1 =:|

In the mid-90's Paul Gilbert had advised guitarists learning sweep picking to work on small sections, and ensure rhythmic accuracy.  The lick he suggested used this idea of "bursts", though he didn't call it that:

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true
   notes =|: :8 8d/1 5u/1 6u/2 5u/3 8d/1 5u/1 6u/2 5u/3 |
   notes :16 8d/1 5u/1 6u/2 5u/3 8d/1 5u/1 6u/2 5u/3 8d/1 5u/1 6u/2 5u/3 8d/1 5u/1 6u/2 5u/3 =:|

The trouble with bursts
-----------------------

One small issue with bursts to be aware of is that it creates a slightly different set of conditions for your nervous system.

For example, if you're playing a steady stream of 16ths:

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true tablature=false
   notes =|: :16 5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5/1 =:|


That's quite different for your nerves than playing this:

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true tablature=false
   notes =|: :q 5-5-5/1 :16 5-5-5-5/1 =:|

In the first example, you're doing a "steady-state" motion, with regular movements and impulses.  In the second, you're starting and stopping, more or less, and it can create subtle difficulties.  For example, when I first started using bursts, I'd actually start them from nothing, like so:

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true tablature=false
   notes =|: :q ## :16 5-5-5-5/1 :q 5/1 ## =:|

My bursts always started incredibly sloppy -- I was missing notes, out of time, etc.  After careful observation, I realized that during steady-state picking, I had a very slight engagement or activation with my picking arm triceps, which I figured was stabilizing my arm.  When I slightly engaged my triceps before starting the burst, everything started to work again.  This engagement/activation may be a weak point in my technique, I'm not sure!  But at least it illustrates the potential difficulties of bursts.

I still believe bursts are potentially a useful technique, but if you're still working on your picking motion, you may want your bursts to be slightly longer, e.g. 2 beats of 16 notes (8 pickstrokes).  The longer duration ensures that you can get into the rhythm and feel of the motion, but it's still short enough that your mind and body won't try to introduce extra extraneous effort in the motion.
