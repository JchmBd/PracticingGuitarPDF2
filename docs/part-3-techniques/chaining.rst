   Play two notes perfectly, at speed.  Then add notes before it (back chaining) of after it (forward chaining).


Suppose you have this lick:

Instead of trying to play the whole thing in one shot, with Chaining, you start at one end, and gradually add individual notes, playing each small segment perfectly and at the final tempo, until you’ve built up the whole chain.  You can build the chain backwards, or forwards.

Backwards chaining

First, you’d start with the two notes at the end, and make sure you can play them perfectly and up to tempo:
… then add the note prior, repeating the process:
… then the next note prior:
… and so on until you reach the beginning.

When using backwards chaining, you may occasionally find that when you add another link to the chain, you have to re-orchestrate all subsequent fingers, due to an incorrect fingering or position choice.  It’s a small annoyance, so you might want to use Forwards Chaining as well to work out the “big picture”.

"Often when adding the next note in the phrase, the fingering and the choreography have to be tweaked for the previous notes to enable best playing of the added note. As one continues to apply this one note added at a time method, one soon learns how to anticipate the best fingering and choreogrpahy for the entire phrase."


Why this works:

With backwards chaining, you are always moving from new, less secure territory -- the new notes you add at the beginning of the chain -- into old, secure territory -- the notes at the end of the chain).  Fluency and speed in playing is a function of a few things, but one of the primary ones is your speed and clarity of thought.  You cannot play what your mind cannot comprehend (I don’t believe it matters that comprehension is audio, visual, tactile, etc).  By playing from less secure to more secure, your mind will more clearly comprehend what you’re doing, and your hands will as well.
 
Another reason this is a great technique is its emphasis on follow-through.  Have you ever started to play a lick or song, and it feels great for the first stretch, but then you get to middle and it starts to get fuzzy, and you get lost?  Me too.  There are many reasons for this, but one is that, during a “usual” practice session, or thinking about a lick or song, you’re always _starting_ it, always working the beginning, and perhaps not really paying attention to the rest.  With backward chaining, you practice the end more, so it exposes and deals with the memory weaknesses.

Forwards chaining is the other way around:

First, you’d start with the two notes at the beginning, and make sure you can play them perfectly and up to tempo:
… then add the next note, repeating the process:
… then the next note:
… and so on until you reach the end.

Forward chaining is useful because your fingering selections will likely be more accurate as you work through the passage -- i.e., the choices you make while chaining will be those you use during the final performance.

Why this works

You’re building up the lick atom by atom!

It’s good to try both forwards and backwards chaining even on the same lick: sometimes you end up with different choices that are more accurate or easier to play, they’re better suited for your mind and hands.
