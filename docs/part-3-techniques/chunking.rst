   Take one long phrase or idea, and break it up into chunks, with clearly identified "target notes" at the start of each chunk.  When practicing and playing, aim for these target notes.

"If we try to play a scale or passage without dividing
it into several groups with regular accents, then for each
movement of each single finger a separate willimpulse
must be sent from the central nervous system. In this
way we would be able to play our scale in slow tempo
only. Uniting two notes in one group by an accent on
the first note will enable us to play a given succession
somewhat faster because now only one will-impulse is
needed to produce two tones. The faster we want to play,
the greater the number of tones that have to be united
into one group. Thus, many volitional impulses, each
directed to a single action, would be replaced by a few
directed to the compound action. For exceedingly rapid
scale playing (in the finale of Chopinâ€™s G minor Ballade,
for example), we should unite seven notes in one will
impulse. By doing so we gain the advantage of playing
the regularly repeated patterns of notes and finger successions with octave orientation. Because of this orientation, it is easier to unite seven notes in one group than
six or eight. Thus, at each strong beat we send a will
impulse and are not conscious of the notes which are
played between these strong beats. These links have been
worked out previously and stored in the motor region of
the cortex.

In fact he would
soon also be able to play it fast in its entirety, but with
frequent stops at definite points: at the end of each
measure or every two measures, During these stops he
would have an opportunity to prepare himself for the
next section. But to learn to play this piece fast and without stops the pupil would have to learn to think fast.

Outlining: only play the "main" notes of a phrase, and make sure they're clearly accented in your mind.
