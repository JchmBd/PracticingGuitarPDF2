   For polyphonic music or fingerstyle, play the melody with proper fingering and full expression, and only pretend to play any other voices.

If you're playing a multi-voice piece, such as a fingerstyle arrangement, it's easy for the melody slip slightly out of control, or to lose the overall balance of the voices.  After a solid rhythm, a singing melody is the most important thing for your listeners.

Ghosting lets you focus on the melody, without forgetting about the rest of the hands and fingers.  For this technique, you only play the melody, but continue to finger and pretend-play the accompaniment.

For example, here's a simple arrangement of the first few bars of the tune "Freight Train":

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true
   voice
   notes :q 3/1 0/1 3/2 0/2 | :q 4/3 :8 3/1 6/2 :h T6/2
   voice
   notes :8 3/5 2/4 3/6 2/4 3/5 2/4 3/6 2/4 | 3/6 3/4 5/5 3/4 3/6 3/4 5/5 3/4

If you weren't satisfied with how you're expressing the melody, just play that, continuing to position and move all fingers (fretting and plucking hand), including non-melody ones, where they would be if you were playing the full piece (note -- though the notes are marked as "X", they're not muted/muffled notes, they're just here as a reminder):

.. vextab::

   options tab-stems=true
   tabstave
   voice
   notes :q 3/1 0/1 3/2 0/2 | :q 4/3 :8 3/1 6/2 :h T6/2
   voice
   notes :8 X/5 X/4 X/6 X/4 X/5 X/4 X/6 X/4 | X/6 X/4 X/5 X/4 X/6 X/4 X/5 X/4

Everything should be the same for all other voices.  Experiment with fretting or simply placing the other non-melody fingers.

Why this works
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For complex pieces, it's easy to get absorbed in the mechanics of playing, and accidentally lose the melody.  By ghosting non-melody voices, you'll be able to catch all of the subtleties of the melody, and focus on them, but in a realistic manner.
