   Explore left hand technical issues by reducing consecutive notes to a single chord (effecively playing those chunks at infinite speed), and then gradually arpeggiate those notes.

Left hand only: chord attack / parallel set

If you can't play it with the left hand only, you can't pick it.

FH practicing: Try raising the fingers slightly before bringing them down, for legato practice.  inhibitory

"In the central nervous system, reciprocal relations exist between flexors (bending muscles) and extensors (straightening muscles). The intense excitation of flexors will call forth intense inhibition of extensors, and vice versa. Since the inhibitory process is weaker than the process of excitation, a slight raising of fingers (intense excitation of extensors) before their descent into the keys appears to be a valuable means for strengthening weak inhibition of flexors."
