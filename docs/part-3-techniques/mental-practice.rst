   Play away from the instrument.

Mental Practice, or mental performance, is playing the music in your mind, or on an imagined guitar.  It's an extremely useful for working on technique and repertoire.

For Technique
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

“A player's fingers cannot travel faster than the
thoughts which direct his fmgers on the keyboard. ‘Therefore his velocity depends first on his mental agility in
grasping printed music and coordinating finger movements.”

It’s possible, though mentally very tiring, to practice some technical things away from the guitar. You could give it a shot, and see if it works for you. If you don’t have much time to physically practice, you may still be able to benefit from mental practice.

So eventual practice just consists of re-creating everything in your mind. Next time you are practicing, notice the weight of the guitar, the feel of the frets and strings under your fretting hand, any what the pic feels like, what the strings feel like if your finger picking, and of course the sound. You should really pay attention to the sound sing every note of every cord, notice every dynamic and every note.

If you practice something intently, it should be available to you for review after practicing. This helps this review of it will help with retention and retrieval. Since playing is a psychic phenomenon, having practising it’s mental retrieval will help you get rid of mental tension, which eventually leads to physical tension. The faster you can think, the better you can play.

You could drill yourself on this: take your guitar, play something simple that you know fairly well, just a few bars or even a few notes. Then put your put your guitar down, close your eyes, and try to re-create everything to the best of your ability.This may take a couple of tries, but you might find that it results in increased presence while you are actually playing. This increased presence or alertness can only help your practicing.

achieve technique, not by the amount of time spent in
practicing, but by the quality of this labor, by the strength
of will and attention directing the mind on musical problems. Hugo Riemann wrote: “It is impossible to develop
velocity otherwise than through exercise of the telegraphic
apparatus from brain to muscles. The process from within outward cannot be replaced by anything.” Theodor
Leschetizky used to say that intellect played the chief
part in correct study; he recommended correcting mistakes mentally before playing a passage again.


For Repertoire
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MP provides a clearer understanding of the structure of the
composition, etc., because you can now analyze them in your head. You can even "practice"
without a piano, at speeds that the fingers cannot manage.


A more useful use of your time away from the guitar might be to practice more conceptual things. For example, you can think about licks and repertoire. For lakes, you can think of the sound of the Lich as it’s played, it’s placement on the fretboard, and different ways to think about it. For repertoire, you can think of the structure, and review playing it mentally in your head.

Note that mental playing might be a mix of detailed conscious thought, and unconscious thought. What I mean by this, is that when you are planning fast fluid material, you are usually not conscious of every note. When you are reviewing something mentally, you might find that you simply can’t think of what you played. That’s normal. I’m actually not sure what the best ratio of conscious thought to unconscious thought is. For some repertoire, such as classical or some finger style, conscious mental review of every measure of a piece might be necessary, in order to prevent mental blackouts, which is a common experience for say classical pianist, but they are operating under a different set of constraints. Thank God we are not them.

In order to memorize well, it is necessary to practice memory away from the piano using
MP. This saves time because you can practice even when no piano is available, and greatly
strengthens the memory because you don't have the piano and hand memory as "crutches".

concept that all mistakes originate in the brain. Test your memory with MP and it will reveal
how much you still depend on hand memory even after you had acquired keyboard, etc.,
memory. MP is one of the best tests of memory.

For Imagination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Don't be passive and
wait for the music to come out of the piano, but actively anticipate the music you want to
produce – which is the ultimate MP and the best way to execute a convincing performance.


“The full acoustic picture of the music must be lodged in the mind, before it can be expressed through the hands.” Then the “playing is simply the manual expression of something [a pianist] knows.”™
—Josef Hofmann
