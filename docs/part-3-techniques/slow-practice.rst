   At the end of every practice session, play things at a slow tempo -- but not in slow motion.

It is
the task of the teacher to strengthen both the inhibitory
and the excitatory processes.

In such cases, it is important that all movements be
executed energetically. It should be emphasized that slow
playing does not necessarily mean slow motion. The
movements must be swift but clearly separated from each
other.

In such cases, it is important that all movements be
executed energetically. It should be emphasized that slow
playing does not necessarily mean slow motion. The
movements must be swift but clearly separated from each
other. Deep legato practicing is extremely useful for
strengthening weak nervous processes. After-pressure of
each finger is recommended.

But attention! De not allow any overexertion of the
participating muscles or involvement of unnecessary ones.
The best control can be realized in the following way:
while pressing a key rather strongly, try to move the wrist
up and down smoothly and evenly, sensing its flexibility.
Combining strong finger grasp with a flexible wrist is one
of the main problems of piano technique. The teacher
must strive to develop this ability in his pupils.

Slow and extremely even playing is indispensable, not only for obtaining clear proprioceptive sensations but for strengthening the inhibitory process.


For any passage with complex left hand movements, play with loud, distinct, clear stacatto hammers, at a slow tempo.

Legato scale practice

Fingers in position above string
staccato touch
pianissimo, all attention on fingertips
down with one finger, up with the adjacent, synchronized
*slight* press of the string once fretted, to strengthen the connection

This is tiring work, for the central nervous system.


Periodically, use the pick to stop any string from ringing immediately after you've picked it.  This regulates the strength of your impulses, and exercises the inhibitory reflex.


From "Proprioception" section

Proprioceptive sensations and the ability to make the finest inner analysis and synthesis of these sensations are necessary for acquiring motor skill. These motor signals also represent the only material through which our motor centers operate, the basis on which dexterous motor acts are built and developed. Hence, when aiming for the most efficient piano practicing, we have to take care that our proprioceptive sensations are clear and distinct. Slow playing serves this aim to some extent.

From the physiological point of view the answer seems to be that, while practicing, fingers should be raised to obtain the most distinct sensations from their action, but only as much as is needed for this purpose.

A slight pressure into the key after its full depression is recommended in slow practicing. Tactile sensations as well as sensations from finger muscle contractions will be strengthened in this way.

Practicing legato passages with staccato touch will “engrave more firmly on your memory the order in which the notes (and the fingers which produce those notes) follow each other.” It will also sharpen proprioceptive sensations from the more distinct activity of fngers. This practicing must be finger staccato as distinct from hand staccato or forearm staccato. Soft playing should prevail, since in forte the unavoidable participation of upper parts of the playing apparatus (big muscles) would overshadow finer finger sensations.

Therefore, among several varieties of practice for finger articulation, the following is one of the best: first, fingers are prepared on the keys to be pressed. Each finger then presses with a light downward movement only, never leaving its key. Thus the size of finger movement is equal to the depth of the key.  And playing proceeds very slowly, pianissimo, with the whole attention concentrated on fingertips. The downward movement of one finger must be synchronized with the movement of the preceding finger as it lets its key rise. At the slightest sensation of fatigue in the upper parts of the arm, this practicing should be stopped. (It is rather hard to hold the weight of the forearm without support.) By experimenting, the proper balance will be found, so that longer sections and eventually a whole study or piece can be played in this way. Such practicing is tiring to our central nervous system, as it requires finest tonal control along with control over the accompanying sensations, and this is especially hard in pianissimo. But the consequence of such practicing is a feeling of strength in the fingers. This result would be surprising to the representatives of the old finger school. Of course it is not muscle, but nerve command over the fingers that is being strengthened!
