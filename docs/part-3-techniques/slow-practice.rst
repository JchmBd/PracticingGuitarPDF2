   At the end of every practice session, play things at a slow tempo -- but not in slow motion.

It is
the task of the teacher to strengthen both the inhibitory
and the excitatory processes.

In such cases, it is important that all movements be
executed energetically. It should be emphasized that slow
playing does not necessarily mean slow motion. The
movements must be swift but clearly separated from each
other.

In such cases, it is important that all movements be
executed energetically. It should be emphasized that slow
playing does not necessarily mean slow motion. The
movements must be swift but clearly separated from each
other. Deep legato practicing is extremely useful for
strengthening weak nervous processes. After-pressure of
each finger is recommended.

But attention! De not allow any overexertion of the
participating muscles or involvement of unnecessary ones.
The best control can be realized in the following way:
while pressing a key rather strongly, try to move the wrist
up and down smoothly and evenly, sensing its flexibility.
Combining strong finger grasp with a flexible wrist is one
of the main problems of piano technique. The teacher
must strive to develop this ability in his pupils.

Slow and extremely even playing is indispensable, not only for obtaining clear proprioceptive sensations but for strengthening the inhibitory process.


For any passage with complex left hand movements, play with loud, distinct, clear stacatto hammers, at a slow tempo.

Legato scale practice

Fingers in position above string
staccato touch
pianissimo, all attention on fingertips
down with one finger, up with the adjacent, synchronized
*slight* press of the string once fretted, to strengthen the connection

This is tiring work, for the central nervous system.
