   Ensure your physical and mental processes are under control by intentionally interrupting (stopping) them periodically.

The ability to play evenly and the ability to
slow down at any point in a passage serve as criteria of
precise and sufficient inhibition.

Stopping practice should be used not only to control what you just did and what you are going to do, but to force yourself to detain the impulse for the next movement for as long as you want at any given moment. This is an excellent means for strengthening inhibition. It is especially hard to stop before strong beats.
