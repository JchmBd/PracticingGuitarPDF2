   If aiming for a goal tempo, try going much faster and much slower, to learn how you need to do it.

Method 1: Floor It, then refine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Suppose you want to play the :ref:`kreutzer_etude_no_5` at 160 BPM:

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true key=Eb time=12/8
   notes :8 3/1 6/1 4/1 3/1 6/2 4/2 3/2 6/2 4/2 3/2 5/3 3/3 | 4/2 3/1 6/2 4/2 3/2 5/3 4/3 7/3 5/3 4/3 7/4 5/4 |

If you can't quite get it, setting the metronome at 160 and repeating endlessly won't give you or your body much chance to experiment and learn about playing.  Shake it up a bit!

1. Ensure you have a rough idea of how you will play it -- work out basics at a comfortable tempo.

2. Floor it!  Put the metronome *beyond* the target speed -- sometimes far beyond it, and see what happens.  Here's the metronome at 200!

.. vextab::
   :width: 500

   tabstave notation=true key=Eb time=12/8
   notes :8 3/1 6/1 4/1 3/1 6/2 4/2 3/2 6/2 4/2 3/2 5/3 3/3

Work on that for a short while, at most one minute.

.. warning:: It is very important that you continue to stay loose -- if you tighten up to hit tempo, you're teaching your body the wrong thing!  Always aim for ease in playing.

3. Take the metronome back down to the target tempo, see how it feels:

.. vextab::
   :width: 500

   tabstave notation=true key=Eb time=12/8
   notes :8 3/1 6/1 4/1 3/1 6/2 4/2 3/2 6/2 4/2 3/2 5/3 3/3

4. Then, give yourself a break, and take it down to 120, or 100, and see how easy it feels at that tempo.

.. vextab::
   :width: 500

   tabstave notation=true key=Eb time=12/8
   notes :8 3/1 6/1 4/1 3/1 6/2 4/2 3/2 6/2 4/2 3/2 5/3 3/3

5. Then take it back up to the target tempo of 160, and try it again, seeing if you can bring forward any of the ease that you had at the lower tempo.

Keep going back and forth, up and down, with the tempo, sprinting a little bit at high speed, relaxing and cleaning up at lower speed, always exploring and trying to keep things accurate and loose.

Method 2: Slowing down from fast
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you can get through a passage -- even roughly -- another way of working on it, as explained by `Jason Sulliman, trombonist and educator <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9X4h-cY1uw&t=12m43s>`__, is to try at the top speed, and then bring it down:

* Start at target tempo (160 here), and try to play the passage.  Drop the tempo until you can play it perfectly.  e.g., on day 1, you might need to drop it to 130.  Note that tempo in your practice journal.
* The next day, start at the target, try to play it, and again drop the tempo until you can play it perfectly.  e.g. on day 2, you might drop it to 132.
* And so on.

Why this works
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* By keeping the goal tempo firmly in mind, and always incorporating it into your practice, you don't build a "speed wall"
* Cleaning things up at slower tempos keeps your accuracy high, but continuing to spend time at fast tempos keeps the goal of speed and ease in mind.
