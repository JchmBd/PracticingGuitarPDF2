   If aiming for a goal tempo, overshoot it, hit it, and undershoot it.


Shawn Lane style variations


Jason Sulliman style working up to it

Then, once you have it roughly working at the top tempo, you slow it down.  But start from a target tempo and drop the metronome, and aim to play that.  Then chart how that tempo works.  eg if the top tempo is 175, try to play it at 175.  If you can't play it perfectly, drop the tempo again, and so on down until you reach the point where you play it perfectly.  Maybe today you had to drop it down to 130.  You play through it a few times at that tempo.  Then the next day, start at 175, and drop until you play it perfectly -- maybe it's 132 or 135.  And so on. (Note this is from Jason Sulliman)
