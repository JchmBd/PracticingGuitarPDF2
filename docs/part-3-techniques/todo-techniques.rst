(Pending Documentation)
=======================

These are rough ideas for techniques that *may* still require documentation -- I'm not sure if they're worth including, actually.


* Change your picking
* Rest variations
* Sequencing (e.g, for 1-2-3-4-5 lick, play 1-2-3-4, then 2-3-4-5- etc)
* Silent chord press
* Cycling (same groups of notes)
* Staccato picking
* Right-over-left tapping (per Glen Gould practice)
* Simplify: Break any movement into distinct building blocks, and practice those building blocks separately, aiming for higher speeds than your target tempo.  Then combine them.  (This one seems almost silly ... not sure if useful!) B notes: https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=3371.msg30144#msg30144
* Repeated Note Groups: Chaining on steroids: take a passage, and briefly work on the two-note chains starting at every single note.  Then do three-note chains, then four, and so on, until you've thoroughly explored every twist and turn.

  * www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php/topic,2449.msg21217/topicseen.html#msg21217
  * chunks of 2, 3, 4 notes, etc.  keep the picking correct (upstroke/downstroke)
