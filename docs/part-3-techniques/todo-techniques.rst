Other Techniques
================

These are techniques that *may* still require documentation.  At this moment, I'm not sure they're really useful or if more detail is necessary.

Simplify
--------

Break any movement into distinct building blocks, practice those building blocks separately, and then combine them.  (This one may be obvious to some but new to others ... not sure if useful!)

For example, take Travis picking of a two-chord progression, C to G.  If you can't shift from chord to chord lightning fast with no effort, then Travis picking will be tough for you.  Just work on shifting from chord to chord, no effort, no stress, for a few minutes, interleaving that with other practice.  Repeat that a few times a day.

Fretting hand shifts to new chords can often be practiced independently for repertoire.  Simply working on each pair of chords in a progression, silently shifting from chord to chord, can get that process to be more automatic, before you add other components like melodies and rhythms.

Another more fiendish example would be something like the following (part of a longer arpeggio sequence):

.. vextab::
   :debug:

   :16 12d/1 7u/1 8d/2 9u/3 11d/1 8u/1 10d/2 11u/3

If you can't make the fretting hand shift and fingering quickly and easily, work on that before adding the alternate picking.


Repeated Note Groups
--------------------

Essentially, Chaining on steroids: take a passage, and briefly work on the two-note chains starting at every single note.  Then do three-note chains, then four, and so on, until you've thoroughly explored every twist and turn.  You should complete a given passage in a single practice session (i.e., you can go longer than 20 minutes), and so you shouldn't pick a passage with too many notes.

Brief example: given the following G minor arpeggio:

.. vextab::
   tabstave notation=true key=Bb
   notes :16 3d/6 6u/6 5d/5 5u/4 8d/4 7u/3 8d/2 6u/1

Work on every two notes, repeating each one a few times until they feel good at tempo:

.. vextab::
   tabstave notation=true key=Bb
   notes :16 3d/6 6u/6 | 6u/6 5d/5 | 5d/5 5u/4 | 5u/4 8d/4 | 8d/4 7u/3 | 7u/3 8d/2 | 8d/2 6u/1

Then make 3-note groups, again repeating each a few times:

.. vextab::
   tabstave notation=true key=Bb
   notes :16 3d/6 6u/6 5d/5 | 6u/6 5d/5 5u/4 | 5d/5 5u/4 8d/4 | 5u/4 8d/4 7u/3 | 8d/4 7u/3 8d/2 | 7u/3 8d/2 6u/1

Then 4:

.. vextab::
   tabstave notation=true key=Bb
   notes :16 3d/6 6u/6 5d/5 5u/4 | 6u/6 5d/5 5u/4 8d/4 | 5d/5 5u/4 8d/4 7u/3 | 5u/4 8d/4 7u/3 8d/2 | 8d/4 7u/3 8d/2 6u/1

etc.

This requires a lot of patience to work through, but this dogged working through of any tricky sections might give some insight.


Tone and articulation variations
--------------------------------

Varying the tone and articulation can exercise your playing muscles in interesting ways.  For example:

* Staccato picking: When picking a string, immediately after the pick has gone through the string to the other side, lightly place the side of your pick against the string.  The note will be short and staccato.  The great Rick Graham calls this "planting technique" and demonstrates it `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JSCmIBzabU>`__.  As Rick discusses, this promotes an economy of movement.  I believe that it's also effective because it works on the regulating the amount of force you're using for the downstroke (see :ref:`excitation_and_inhibition`).
* Altering pick angle: changing the angle of hte pick changes its tone.  If you can't easily alter the angle of your pick, it may be a sign of tension.  Try it out, see how it works.
* Volume variation is already covered in :tech:ref:`dynamics`.
* Fretting hand articulations and dynamics are challenging.  Try altering the volume of your slurs (hammer-ons and pull-offs), or make them staccato.
