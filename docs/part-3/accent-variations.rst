   Accent all notes at the start of every beat.  This adds structure for your mind and for listeners.

If a pianist plays a passage without regular natural accentuation (these accents should be very light, hardly
audible), no matter how distinct his finger work is, he
will give his listeners the impression that his playing is
somewhat indistinct. Regularity of metrical division is
important for clear auditory perception of performed music as well as for execution,

When any exercise, scale or section of a passage is singled out for
practice, it must always be divided into clearly accented,
regular metrical groups. It must also be finished on the
strong beat to give a proper feeling for the end of the unit.
