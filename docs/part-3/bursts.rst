   Loop over a section, playing first at half speed, then full speed.

Playing a short section of a lick at half speed (a.k.a. half time) can let your brain "lock in" to the rhythm that the lick should fit into.  For example, if you play the following 2-beat lick for several beats, your mind can quickly wander, muscles tire, and you lose accuracy:

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true
   notes =|: :16 6-8-6-5/2 6-8-6-5/2 =:|

Playing a short section of the lick at half speed can let you really feel the beat, and see how accurately you're playing the lick.  The slower portion also gives your nervous system a chance to relax and prepare for the next attempt.

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true
   notes =|: :q 6-8-6-5/2 | :16 6-8-6-5/2 6-8-6-5/2 :h 6/2 =:|

For sextuplet licks, try playing parts of the lick in slower triples:

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true time=12/8
   notes :16 =|: 8-5-7-8-7-5/1 8-5-7-8-7-5/1 =:|

And with bursts:

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true time=12/8
   notes =|: :8 8-5-7-8-7-5/1 :16 8-5-7-8-7-5/1 8-5-7-8-7-5/1 =:|

In the mid-90's Paul Gilbert had advised guitarists learning sweep picking to work on small sections, and ensure rhythmic accuracy.  The lick he suggested used this idea of "bursts", though he didn't call it that:

.. vextab::

   tabstave notation=true
   notes =|: :8 8d/1 5u/1 6u/2 5u/3 8d/1 5u/1 6u/2 5u/3 |
   notes :16 8d/1 5u/1 6u/2 5u/3 8d/1 5u/1 6u/2 5u/3 8d/1 5u/1 6u/2 5u/3 8d/1 5u/1 6u/2 5u/3 =:|
