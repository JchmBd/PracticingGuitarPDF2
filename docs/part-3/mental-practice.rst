“The full acoustic picture of the music must be lodged in the mind, before it can be expressed through the hands.” Then the “playing is simply the manual expression of something [a pianist] knows.”™

"Walter Gieseking once said that the main factor in technique is the brain; the main condition for technique is
concentration; and the main subject of technique is evenness."

“A player's fingers cannot travel faster than the
thoughts which direct his fmgers on the keyboard. ‘Therefore his velocity depends first on his mental agility in
grasping printed music and coordinating finger movements.”


achieve technique, not by the amount of time spent in
practicing, but by the quality of this labor, by the strength
of will and attention directing the mind on musical problems. Hugo Riemann wrote: “It is impossible to develop
velocity otherwise than through exercise of the telegraphic
apparatus from brain to muscles. The process from withinoutward cannot be replaced by anything.” Theodor
Leschetizky used to say that intellect played the chief
part in correct study; he recommended correcting mistakes mentally before playing a passage again.

It is evident, then, that the main attention of thoughtful pianists and piano teachers should be directed to
questions connected with the activity of the central nervous system. The roots of technique are in our central
nervous system, The problems connected with muscular
conditions and outward appearance of our playing apparatus are important, but they are secondary.
