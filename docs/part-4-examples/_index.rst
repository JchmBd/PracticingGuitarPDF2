Applying the ideas in this book to pieces, licks, and techniques.

I used to practice songs or techniques by just starting from the beginning and playing until I hit a tough spot.  I'd tackle a few of these tough spots but never get really confident or *secure* in playing them, and I'd stop playing it that day.  The next day I'd start from the beginning again, and not get any further.  Eventually I'd get bored and stop trying, never having really learned the piece.  My "practicing" wasn't really practice!  This approach did work for some things, but for others I needed a better routine.

In this section I describe how I used the techniques in this book when practising repertoire and technique.  I can only speak from my own experience, but hopefully itâ€™s useful, and will give you some ideas that you can apply for your own practising.

If you have any question, let me know in the feedback. Good luck!
