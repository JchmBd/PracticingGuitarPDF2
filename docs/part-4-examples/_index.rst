Part IV - Examples

In this section I describe how I used the techniques in this book when practising repertoire and technique.  I can only speak from my own experience, but hopefully itâ€™s useful, and will give you some ideas that you can apply for your own practising.

If you have any question, let me know in the feedback. Good luck!
