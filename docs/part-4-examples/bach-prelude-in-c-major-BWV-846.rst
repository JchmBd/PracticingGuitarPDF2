Bach Prelude in C Major
=======================

A "shorthand" version of the full score is at :ref:`bach_wtc_prelude_in_c_major`.

This piece starts off deceptively simply: the first few chords are straightforward, and the fingerpicking throughout is easy; however, it becomes quite challenging, and is harmonically challenging.  Also, every measure is different and has its own challenges, so it takes longer to master than you might expect.

My general overall approach was:

* practice in 20-minute sessions
* start from the end of the piece, and work backwards
* practice one small chunk (usually one measure) for one session, over as many sessions as needed
* join successive chunks once complete

When working on chunks, I used several techniques as necessary:

* :tech:ref:`simplify` and :tech:ref:`handsseparate` for fast shifts of difficult chords
* :tech:ref:`chaining` for clear chord transitions
* :tech:ref:`slowpractice` to reduce tension
* :tech:ref:`droppingnotes` to ensure a smooth and solid bass line
* :tech:ref:`mentalpractice` between practice sessions

Practising the prelude

For this piece, if you haven’t heard it already, check out a few renditions. This is originally a harpsichord piece, or early piano piece, I’m not sure. So listen to some piano performances or some other guitar arrangements, including mine, to hear some possibilities.

I establish your practice schedule. I always recommend many shorter practice. Rather than long ones. So, rather than try to play through the whole piece over a course of two hours, I approach things in 20 minute chunks, as outlined in :ref:`time_and_schedule`.

Some great teachers and players advise to take things one section at a time, perfect them, and join sections. That’s great advice, but we can supplement that with some other thoughts and practice techniques.

With this piece, I was working out the arrangement while practising it, so my usual practice method was kind of thrown out the window. So I’ll try to reconstruct how I would have practised if I had the arrangement prepared before hand.

Overall approach

A good technique for memorizing complex repertoire is back training link. So, for this piece I started practising measures from the end, and worked backwards. Then I would focus on the transitions between these sections using forward training, and dropping notes.  I would practice each section following the 7 x 20 rule, meaning I would try to play a section 7 times perfectly within 20 minutes, and then stopping. Since improvement happens during rest., It’s good to practice very concentrated for aperiod of time, and then MoveOn.  I wasn’t used to playing this kind of repertoire, and it took my hands and arms quite a while to find the right motions and to acclimate. You can see the full practice log for this piece down below.

I’ll give you a rough overview of the process I used for this piece. Due to the fact that I was arranging and solving technical problems at the same time, my approach was very non-linear, but it was still methodical.

Starting at the last measure

When I tried playing this measure, I immediately ran into what I found to be tricky, which is the pull offs to the open strings. So, I started off with just that, devoting probably 15 minutes on that in my first day. It’s a lot of gentle experimentation, trying to get the right sound, trying to release tension on the pull offs, And trying to find the right hand and arm position. This alone was more than enough for me for the first session. I know, now, I could have tried to also play the previous measure, and practice both of those, but to me that’s not effective. I know it’s just one measure, I but this is not a race, this is a long term, sustained, concentrated and yet relaxed and gentle process of experimentation and observation.  Are working on this one measure and bringing it to a high standard will raise my overall performance of this piece. And it will take time for my hands to sort it out,. So the first day was this measure. And then the second day started with the exact same measure, me playing it to see if I had in fact mastered it. And I hadn’t. So what do you do? I practice the exact same measure again sometimes even narrowing my scope to just a handful of beats such as the pull offs. The pull offs are the hardest part in this measure for me. 

Since this measure felt completely foreign to me, I wasn’t aiming for a super high standard at first. I just wanted a mid range temple that I could play evenly and rhythmically accurately, with no undue stress anywhere in my body. When I could do that, it was time for the next measure.

F major



This measure is a lot easier than the last measure. So, I was able to play this measure relatively well in a short period of time.

Joining the measures

These measures were actually quite easy to join, so I won’t go into much detail here. Actually for the next few measures, the fingerings and transitions were relatively clear, so I am going to skip a little bit further back in the peace and two places that really presented some challenges, and where the practice techniques came in handy.

TheF section

After playing after several attempts, after a few attempts, I wasn’t happy with how this section was feeling. It was way too jumpy way too tense. I mean it’s pretty hard there’s some very unusual chord shapes, and it’s easy to get lost in the small details. Paragraph

Instead of just hammering away at the courts, hoping that things would come together, I used a few different methods to break down the section.

And the progress here again was really experimental. Trying something, seeing how it felt, then trying another technique, looking for something that would help. Not getting bogged down in it. Just short practice sessions 10 minutes maybe each day, again a lot of improvement that I get happens after practice sessions and in between practice sessions I can’t control it all that I can do is continually direct it continually refocus myself and just really disinterested or interested and gentle observation.

Dropping notes. Since the courts since the piece is a simple baseline and arpeggiated chords on top, one way to approach it is to simply work on the baseline and forget about the top notes. Note that you still put your fingers in position as if you were going to play the top knots, and you use the correct figuring for the bass notes. So one practice session or a part of one practice session might look was me just playing this:

Vicks tab example and recording

I then tried playing just the bass notes, followed by one of the melody notes. This ensures that my hands my fingers were in roughly the right spots.

Training to join measures.

To join measures, I would do forward chaining for example to join the F major seven and F sharp diminished chord this chords., I would do something like this:

Backstab example and audio

With this, my focus was on rhythmic accuracy, and ensuring that the top melody note was sustained into the next court.

One thing I found interesting about this was that training would reveal certain efficiencies and economies in my finger movements. For example, when moving from the F major seven chord to the next F sharp diminished chord. 

Slow practice. For every measure, but especially in these tricky ones, slow practice was really useful. I could really notice my finger position, and could observe tension throughout my body. This piece can be fairly demanding, with its big cords with this big sustained cord, So it’s easy to lose track of tension in your shoulders in and in your neck and in your arms, all of which will cause problems when you’re performing or recording it. Just a few minutes of slow practice was enough for me to observe what was going on.

Slow fast slow fast practice. As discussed here, link, I don’t like to practice slowly and gradually increase metronome speed over the course of days weeks or months. So, for this piece, or for whatever challenging measures, I practice slow fast like this sometimes combining that with training etc., I to figure out how to play it or to let my body figure out how to play it with ease.

No I don’t have any real real stats, I would guess that I spent at least 60% or 70% of my time working on just a handful of measures. A great piano teacher, Dorothy Taubman, once said or rather sad that every measure should be as easy to play as the simplest measure. So, take for example the very 1st quart of this piece, a simple cowboy Secord, very easy to play. But this F major 7 to F sharp diminished is for me much more difficult, much more. So by polishing these tough pieces and working out how to play them giving my body extra strategies to figure it out to work it out on its own reduces their complexity.  Each measure should be perfect, like a pearl, and he should be strung together your pieces of string of pearls.

Stubborn measures

Sometimes there are measures that or sections that really just seem resistant to improvement. For me, in this piece there were three list here.

These paragraphs were stubborn not due to any overwhelming technical difficulties like super fast speed. I have the basic technique to play them, but they just weren’t happening.

Like everything else, it just takes quality practice time, concentrated quality practice time spread out so that your body can acclimate. So, I kept a short list of sections that I found difficult. The sections were sometimes just two or three notes, maybe maximum five notes that exposed the problem. For example, for the a minor to D7 transition the issue was keeping the top not ringing while playing the next chords:

Example with audio

I just played these troublesome sections a few times a day, over several days, with slow relaxed focussed practice, to keep refining the image of the section to my brain and hands.

Then, since piecemeal practising can get tedious, I would try to play those short sections in context, where the measure before and measure afterwards, playing it slow and relax just carrying forward the things I found during concentrated practice.

The details here might seem overwhelming and pretty damn tedious. Are so it’s important to keep in mind, so while working on these sections, I was concentrating on the quality of sound, trying to make even the shortest sections something musical. It’s all just give-and-take you know it’s Leica
