Bach Prelude in C Major
=======================

A "shorthand" version of the full score is at :ref:`bach_wtc_prelude_in_c_major`.

*This piece starts off simply enough: the first few chords are straightforward, and the fingerpicking throughout is easy; however, it becomes quite challenging technically and harmonically.  Also, every measure is different, so it takes longer to master than you might expect.  Below are notes about how I approached it -- perhaps it will give you some ideas should you decide to tackle it as well.*

-------

Overall approach
----------------

20-minute chunks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I strictly followed the suggestions described in :ref:`practicing_repertoire`: practicing one single difficult section for 20 minutes, and repeating that on subsequent days until that was reasonably secure.  I would then join these sections.  It is very easy to try to do too much with a seemingly-simple piece like this, so following the 20-minute rule helped me methodically digest everything.

Backwards chaining
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A great technique for memorizing repertoire is to start at the end, and work backwards -- this is called "backchaining".  So, for this piece, rather than starting with the first measure and building forwards, I started with the *last* measure, and built backwards!

When I practice a piece "the usual way" (starting from the first measure, then going to the second, then third, etc.), I usually play it from the beginning until I reach a "hard part", and then I work on that -- which means I feel confident at the start of a practice session, and *progressively less so* as I continue.

With backwards chaining, the opposite is true: I tackle the new/hard stuff first, and then add it on to things that I already know.  Moving from the unknown into the known is a completely different feeling than from known into unknown.

In addition, Working backwards seems to engrave later sections more thoroughly into memory.  You've probably started a song or solo, but then got slightly lost in the middle section where it gets fuzzy and insecure, and you rely on auto-pilot.  With backward chaining, you practice the end more, avoiding the auto-pilot and always staying in control.

Backwards chaining is an interesting practice technique -- give it a shot!

Day 1: Starting with the last G7
--------------------------------

I started with the last two measures:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85

   # G7 and C
   tabstave notation=true tuning=dropd
   notes :16 3/5 $3$ p2/5 $2$ 0/3 0/2 h3/2 $3$ 1/1 $1$ 3/2 $3$ 4/3 $4$ 3/2 $3$ 4/3 $4$ 0/3 $.top.$ $P$ 0/2 $P$ 0/4 h3/4 $.bottom.$ $3$ p2/4 $2$ p0/4 | :w (3/5.2/4.0/3.1/2)
   text :w,.1,G7,|,:w,.1,C

I found the G7 chord surprisingly tough!  The "pulloffs from nowhere" were an unusual technique for me, and it was hard to find the relaxed hand position that let me sustain the notes and still support the pulloffs as I wanted them.  I started off with just this, devoting about 15 minutes on that in my first day. It was a lot of gentle experimentation, trying to get the right sound, and to find a good hand and arm position so I could avoid any tension.

This alone was more than enough for me for the first session.  20 minutes might seem like a long time to spend on one small thing, but breaking things down to digestible chunks is the only way to make real progress, and having a short time limit ensures I don't burn myself out or overreach.

.. tip:: Keep a gentle focus!

   The measure before the G7 is a simple F chord, so I *could* have tried to combine these two measures during the practice session, but decided not to.  It would have diluted my concentration on the G7 chord, and would not speed up my progress at all.  I reminded myself this is not a race, it's a sustained, relaxed, gentle process of experimentation and observation.


Day 2: Repeat
-------------

The next day, I came back to the piece, and per :ref:`practicing_repertoire` I started again with the same measure, playing it to see if I had in fact mastered it. And I hadn’t.  I started my 20-minute timer, and practiced the exact same measure again, narrowing my scope to just the pull-offs.  I had lots of hand tension I had to get rid of!

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85
   tabstave notation=true tuning=dropd
   notes :8 ## :16 0/3 0/2 h3/2 $3$ 1/1 $1$ 3/2 $3$ 4/3 $4$ 3/2 $3$ 4/3 $4$ 0/3 $.top.$ $P$ 0/2 $P$ :q 0/4
   text :w,.1,G7

A few more days
---------------

Though it's a single measure, I spent a few more 20-minute sessions on this section alone.  When you're focused, 20 minutes flies by, and the rest between each session lets your body process and synthesize.

Since this measure felt completely foreign to me, I wasn’t aiming for perfection at first. I just wanted a mid range temple that I could play evenly and rhythmically accurately, with no undue stress anywhere in my body.  I was going to spend a lot of time on the piece and let my mind, hands, and fingers acclimate.

The next measure: F
-------------------

The G7 measure soon felt solid, so I moved to the measure before it, which was much easier:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85

   # F and G7
   tabstave notation=true tuning=dropd
   notes :16 3/5 3/5 3/4 2/3 1/2 1/1 1/2 2/3 1/2 2/3 3/4 2/3 3p0/4 3p0/4
   text :w,.1,F

This is pretty much a regular F chord so I was able to get this in a few minutes.

Since I still had most of the 20 minutes left in the session, I set about joining the measure with what I'd practiced already:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85

   # F and G7
   tabstave notation=true tuning=dropd
   notes :16 3/5 3/5 3/4 2/3 1/2 1/1 1/2 2/3 1/2 2/3 3/4 2/3 3p0/4 3p0/4 | 3/5 $3$ p2/5 $2$ 0/3 0/2 h3/2 $3$ 1/1 $1$ 3/2 $3$ 4/3 $4$ 3/2 $3$ 4/3 $4$ 0/3 $.top.$ $P$ 0/2 $P$ 0/4 h3/4 $.bottom.$ $3$ p2/4 $2$ p0/4 | :w (3/5.2/4.0/3.1/2)
   text :w,.1,F,|,:w,.1,G7,|,:w,.1,C

These were easy to join, so I won’t go into any more detail.

Continuing work
---------------

I continued adding measures, going backwards through the piece, keeping to 20-minute practice chunks.  (I was working on the arrangement at the same time as practicing, so my work wasn't quite linear ... but it was close enough.)

For the next few measures, the fingerings and transitions were relatively clear, so I am going to skip a little bit ahead to what I consider the trickiest measures of the piece, where a few practice techniques came in handy.

The Hard Part
-------------

There are several parts in this piece that are challenging, but the one longest line of toughness is the section in the last third of the piece, starting with F Major 7, going through some diminished chords, and ending on G7:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85
   # Fmaj7 - F#o - Abo - G7
   tabstave notation=true tuning=dropd
   notes :16 3/6 3/4 2/3 1/2 0/1 | 4/6 $1$ 6/5 $3$ 7/4 $4$ 5/3 $2$ 4/2 $1$ | A@3_3/6 $2$ 8/5 $4$ 0/2 5/3 $1$ h7/3 $3$ | 5/6 $1$ 8/5 $4$ 0/3 $(P)$ 0/2 7/3 $3$ p0/3 0/2 7/3
   text :q,.1,Fmaj7,:16, ,|,:q,F#o,:16, ,|,:q,Abo,:16, ,|,:q,G7
   options space=25

.. note:: this is a "shorthand" version of the full score, each chord is played for a full measure.

These are unusual chord shapes and fingerings, and it was very hard to find playable guitar chords that would accurately convey the harmony of the original piano score, and not compromise the melody voices.  Even with the simplest chords I could find, it's a challenge.

.. todo:: CONTINUE HERE

When working on chunks, I used several techniques as necessary:

* :tech:ref:`simplify` and :tech:ref:`handsseparate` for fast shifts of difficult chords
* :tech:ref:`chaining` for clear chord transitions
* :tech:ref:`slowpractice` to reduce tension
* :tech:ref:`droppingnotes` to ensure a smooth and solid bass line
* :tech:ref:`mentalpractice` between practice sessions



TheF section

After playing after several attempts, after a few attempts, I wasn’t happy with how this section was feeling. It was way too jumpy way too tense. I mean it’s pretty hard there’s some very unusual chord shapes, and it’s easy to get lost in the small details.

Instead of just hammering away at the courts, hoping that things would come together, I used a few different methods to break down the section.

And the progress here again was really experimental. Trying something, seeing how it felt, then trying another technique, looking for something that would help. Not getting bogged down in it. Just short practice sessions 10 minutes maybe each day, again a lot of improvement that I get happens after practice sessions and in between practice sessions I can’t control it all that I can do is continually direct it continually refocus myself and just really disinterested or interested and gentle observation.

Dropping notes. Since the courts since the piece is a simple baseline and arpeggiated chords on top, one way to approach it is to simply work on the baseline and forget about the top notes. Note that you still put your fingers in position as if you were going to play the top knots, and you use the correct figuring for the bass notes. So one practice session or a part of one practice session might look was me just playing this:

Vicks tab example and recording

I then tried playing just the bass notes, followed by one of the melody notes. This ensures that my hands my fingers were in roughly the right spots.

Training to join measures.

To join measures, I would do forward chaining for example to join the F major seven and F sharp diminished chord this chords., I would do something like this:

Backstab example and audio

With this, my focus was on rhythmic accuracy, and ensuring that the top melody note was sustained into the next court.

One thing I found interesting about this was that training would reveal certain efficiencies and economies in my finger movements. For example, when moving from the F major seven chord to the next F sharp diminished chord. 

Slow practice. For every measure, but especially in these tricky ones, slow practice was really useful. I could really notice my finger position, and could observe tension throughout my body. This piece can be fairly demanding, with its big cords with this big sustained cord, So it’s easy to lose track of tension in your shoulders in and in your neck and in your arms, all of which will cause problems when you’re performing or recording it. Just a few minutes of slow practice was enough for me to observe what was going on.

Slow fast slow fast practice. As discussed here, link, I don’t like to practice slowly and gradually increase metronome speed over the course of days weeks or months. So, for this piece, or for whatever challenging measures, I practice slow fast like this sometimes combining that with training etc., I to figure out how to play it or to let my body figure out how to play it with ease.


No I don’t have any real real stats, I would guess that I spent at least 60% or 70% of my time working on just a handful of measures. A great piano teacher, Dorothy Taubman, once said or rather sad that every measure should be as easy to play as the simplest measure. So, take for example the very 1st quart of this piece, a simple cowboy Secord, very easy to play. But this F major 7 to F sharp diminished is for me much more difficult, much more. So by polishing these tough pieces and working out how to play them giving my body extra strategies to figure it out to work it out on its own reduces their complexity.  Each measure should be perfect, like a pearl, and he should be strung together your pieces of string of pearls.

Are working on this one measure and bringing it to a high standard will raise my overall performance of this piece.

Stubborn measures

Sometimes there are measures that or sections that really just seem resistant to improvement. For me, in this piece there were three list here.

These paragraphs were stubborn not due to any overwhelming technical difficulties like super fast speed. I have the basic technique to play them, but they just weren’t happening.

Like everything else, it just takes quality practice time, concentrated quality practice time spread out so that your body can acclimate. So, I kept a short list of sections that I found difficult. The sections were sometimes just two or three notes, maybe maximum five notes that exposed the problem. For example, for the a minor to D7 transition the issue was keeping the top not ringing while playing the next chords:

Example with audio

I just played these troublesome sections a few times a day, over several days, with slow relaxed focussed practice, to keep refining the image of the section to my brain and hands.

Then, since piecemeal practising can get tedious, I would try to play those short sections in context, where the measure before and measure afterwards, playing it slow and relax just carrying forward the things I found during concentrated practice.

The details here might seem overwhelming and pretty damn tedious. Are so it’s important to keep in mind, so while working on these sections, I was concentrating on the quality of sound, trying to make even the shortest sections something musical. It’s all just give-and-take you know it’s Leica
