Cliffs of Dover Hybrid Picking Lick
===================================

*This is the famous "pedal tone" lick at the start of the Cliffs of Dover.  I found it useful to decompose the technique to separate components and tackle those indpendently, before putting everything together.  Below is one way to approach it, see if it works for you.*

Here's the tab, transposed down a bit.  All downstrokes are with the pick, all upstrokes are with a finger of the picking hand:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false time=12/8
   notes :16 12d/2 8u/1 12d/3 8u/1 12d/4 8u/1 10d/4 8u/1 10d/3 8u/1 10d/2 8u/1

Overall approach
----------------

Break it down
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When I initially practiced the lick, it was too much to take on; however, as I worked on it, I gradually discovered the different components that I could break it down to (i.e. I could :tech:ref:`simplify` it), and where possible I used :tech:ref:`handsseparate` practice.

I worked on these components one at a time in succession until each was mastered.  I didn't try to work on each in parallel -- for me, that would have been too much.  I also knew that it would take a while for each motion to "bake in" to my mind and body, and so keeping the parts small and digestible helped me gradually conquer the whole thing.

20-minute chunks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each different part, I stuck with the 20-minute practice session described in :ref:`practicing_repertoire`.  When acquiring new motions, e.g. for new techniques, overpracticing can be counterproductive, so keeping the sessions short and experimental let me find what worked for me.  I moved on to the next technique when the current one felt natural at the start of any practice session.

The components
--------------

When either the fretting hand or picking hand becomes tense, that tension can propagate throughout the body, and trip you up.  When all the components work well separately, they can be gradually combined.

Fretting hand
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you subtract picking, the fretting hand needs to effortlessly and evenly bounce across the strings:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false time=12/8
   notes :8 12/2 12/3 12/4 10/4 10/3 10/2

I practiced this seemingly-easy lick in short bursts, ensuring everything was relaxed and efficient.

Picking hand
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Eric talks about a "bounce" technique for his picking hand.  If you take out the fretting hand, e.g. just lay the hand across the strings, you end up with a bunch of downstrokes:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false time=12/8
   notes :8 Xd/2 Xd/3 Xd/4 10d/4 10d/3 10d/2

With a few short sessions, I found that my picking hand seemed to find the required motion very naturally, and it did happen to have a bouncy yet controlled feeling.

Trills
^^^^^^

With the fretting and picking hands nice and loose, you have a good foundation to actually start working on the hybrid picking.  Starting first with a single trill:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false time=2/4
   notes :16 12d/2 8u/1 12d/2 8u/1 :q 12d/3 =:: :16 12d/3 8u/1 12d/3 8u/1 :q 12d/3 =|=

I first worked on single trills (just a few notes), and gradually extended it until I could play a few quickly and easily, as a single unit.  Both hands felt energized.

Trill and jump
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the trills were good, add the jump to the next string.  This is (finally) the kernal of the entire lick:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false
   notes :16 12d/2 8u/1 :8 12d/3 =:: :16 12d/3 8u/1 :8 12d/4 =:: :16 12d/4 8u/1 :8 10d/4

Combining everything
--------------------

At this point, all things felt clean and easy, but when I tried to string the entire lick together it still fell apart!  My mind could handle one trill-and-jump unit, but for some reason stringing many together created tension somewhere.

To work through this, I used :tech:ref:`tempovariations`.  I had the basic motions down cold, so I played short sections of the lick at half speed, and then longer sections at full speed:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false
   notes :8 12d/2 8u/1 12d/3 8u/1 :16 12d/4 8u/1 10d/4 8u/1 10d/3 8u/1 10d/2 8u/1

The benefits of this approach are described in :tech:ref:`tempovariations`:

.. include:: ../part-3-techniques/tempo-variations.rst
   :start-after: start-why-slow-fast-slow-fast-works
   :end-before: end-why-slow-fast-slow-fast-works

I also moved around to different starting points in the lick:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false
   notes :8 12d/3 8u/1 12d/4 8u/1 :16 10d/4 8u/1 10d/3 8u/1 10d/2 8u/1 12d/2 8u/1
