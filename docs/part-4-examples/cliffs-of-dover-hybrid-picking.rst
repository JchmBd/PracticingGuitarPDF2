Cliffs of Dover Hybrid Picking
==============================

For example, suppose you're working on the hybrid picking technique in the Cliffs of Dover intro (all downstrokes are with the pick, all upstrokes are with the middle finger of the picking hand):

Initial lick:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false time=12/8
   notes :16 12d/2 8u/1 12d/3 8u/1 12d/4 8u/1 10d/4 8u/1 10d/3 8u/1 10d/2 8u/1

Hands sep, fretting hand only (hammer ons):

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false time=12/8
   notes :8 12/2 12/3 12/4 10/4 10/3 10/2

Hands sep, picking only:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false time=12/8
   notes :8 12d/2 12d/3 12d/4 10d/4 10d/3 10d/2

Simplify, trills only:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false time=2/4
   notes :16 12d/2 8u/1 12d/2 8u/1 :q 12d/3 =:: :16 12d/3 8u/1 12d/3 8u/1 :q 12d/3 =|=

.. todo:: continue here

Chunking, single trill and jump:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false
   notes :16 12d/2 8u/1 :8 12d/3 =:: :16 12d/3 8u/1 :8 12d/4 =:: :16 12d/4 8u/1 :8 10d/4

After getting an idea of the motions required for this lick, you can play a few notes of this at half speed, and then the rest at full speed:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false
   notes :8 12d/2 8u/1 12d/3 8u/1 :16 12d/4 8u/1 10d/4 8u/1 10d/3 8u/1 10d/2 8u/1

During the slow part, pay close attention to how things feel internally (see :tech:ref:`slowpractice` for notes), find and reduce tension, and then try to replicate that relaxed and accurate playing in the fast part.  During the fast part, note how you play (e.g., hand position, muscle engagement, pick attack), and replicate that during the slow part, so that you get a better idea of how you play it and a more accurate picture of where any excess tension or motion is.  And so on, in an ongoing cycle of refinement.

You can also start the slow picking on different parts of the lick to explore further:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false
   notes :8 12d/3 8u/1 12d/4 8u/1 :16 10d/4 8u/1 10d/3 8u/1 10d/2 8u/1 12d/2 8u/1
