Cliffs of Dover Hybrid Picking
==============================


For example, suppose you're working on the hybrid picking technique in the Cliffs of Dover intro (all downstrokes are with the pick, all upstrokes are with the middle finger of the picking hand):

Initial lick:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false time=12/8
   notes :16 12d/2 8u/1 12d/3 8u/1 12d/4 8u/1 10d/4 8u/1 10d/3 8u/1 10d/2 8u/1

Hands sep, fretting hand only (hammer ons):

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false time=12/8
   notes :8 12/2 12/3 12/4 10/4 10/3 10/2

Hands sep, picking only:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false time=12/8
   notes :8 12d/2 12d/3 12d/4 10d/4 10d/3 10d/2

Simplify, trills only:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false time=2/4
   notes :16 12d/2 8u/1 12d/2 8u/1 :q 12d/3 =:: :16 12d/3 8u/1 12d/3 8u/1 :q 12d/3 =|=

.. todo:: continue here

Chunking, single trill and jump:

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false time=12/8
   notes :16 12d/2 8u/1 12d/3 8u/1 12d/4 8u/1 10d/4 8u/1 10d/3 8u/1 10d/2 8u/1

After getting an idea of the motions required for this lick, you can play a few notes of this at half speed, and then the rest at full speed:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false
   notes :8 12d/2 8u/1 12d/3 8u/1 :16 12d/4 8u/1 10d/4 8u/1 10d/3 8u/1 10d/2 8u/1

During the slow part, pay close attention to how things feel internally (see :tech:ref:`slowpractice` for notes), and find and reduce tension.  Then carry that forward into the fast part.  Use what you learn while working on the fast part to adjust how you play the slow part (e.g., hand position, muscle engagement, pick attack), and so on, in an ongoing cycle of refinement.

You can also start the slow picking on different parts of the lick to explore further:

.. vextab::

   options scale=0.85 tab-stems=true
   tabstave notation=false
   notes :8 12d/3 8u/1 12d/4 8u/1 :16 10d/4 8u/1 10d/3 8u/1 10d/2 8u/1 12d/2 8u/1
