Improvisation
-------------

This one's going to be short.

I can't say anything that hasn't already been said better by Rick Beato, Tomo Fujita, Jens Larsen, and others on YouTube, or by Django Reinhardt, EVH, and <insert your favorite here> on record.

But the single piece of advice I return to time and again for improv is best explained by the great John Mayer (and yes, he is great):

The other tips I usually give, and try to take myself, are standard:

* Transcribe songs and solos you *like*, and play along with the recordings
* Sing the notes you're playing (externally or internally)

In my opinion, everything else -- motifs, substitutions, licks, whatever -- fall out from the above.
