The Two Stages of Practicing
----------------------------

Practicing has two distinct stages:

1. Stage 1 â€“ Investigative. During this stage you are simply trying to figure out what to play and how to play it: the motions that make a given section playable, the right fingerings, the best movements for the sound you want to produce.   Depending on the situation, this alone can take a while: string crossing, skipping, etc. all present challenges.  The end aim of this stage is to get all the technical/musical parameters figured out, so that you can go on to stage 2.

2. Stage 2 - Real practice. A lot of people stop practising when they get it "right", but actually this is a different stage of practice, that only starts when you finally get it right. The aim now is to ingrain on your subconscious what you have consciously figured out on stage 1.

In other words, Stage 1 is practicing until you get it right, and Stage 2 is practicing until you can't get it wrong.  For rock guitar, "wrong" has lots of leeway, and "wrong" doesn't equal "bad".  It's a matter of taste and preference.
