* "Freeing the Caged Bird" by Barbara Lister-Sink

https://www.lister-sinkinstitute.org/freeing-the-caged-bird-dvd

I found this video incredibly helpful and practical.  In this video (excerpt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cVLmQE7_Vs), she outlines the steps to eliminate chronic muscle tension:

 1. Regain awareness of the state of the tensed muscles
 2. Regain conscious control of the tensed muscles
 3. Learn and apply the principles and sensations of efficient muscle use

In particular, she outlines a "Basic Stroke" (excerpt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjSWu8ZADzI), a concise breakdown of the act of playing a note at the piano:

 1. Easy efficient lift of the forearm
 2. Free fall of forearm
 3. Optimal bone alignment and muscular contraction
 4. Instantaneous release

Her work is well worth checking out!  https://www.lister-sinkinstitute.org/

* "The Art of Piano Playing, a Scientific Approach" by George Kochevitsky

Though less immediately practical than Lister-Sink's video, this book made me think of guitar playing more as a process controlled by the subconscious and the central nervous system ... in other words, not muscles, and not muscular tension.  It describes motions as a combination of excitatory and inhibitory signals, that is, muscle contraction and relaxation.  Since I always got locked up with tension when guitar playing, I felt I was missing the inhibitory training necessary.

In retrospect, eliminating excess tension using the ideas from the "Freeing the Caged Bird" video could help the central nervous system as well, because there would be less noise, allowing for finer adjustments and control by the subconscious ... but who knows.
