Speed
=====

- "Speed is very much an illusion. The human ear can take just so many sounds. If you play each note clearly, it will sound fast because the ear has to process a lot of information. If you play so fast that either you miss notes, or they become a blur, it doesnâ€™t sound fast at all, it just sounds messy"

- "In short, make sure you are never ever practising wrong. Like Backaus, only practise the right notes."
