Speed
=====

- "Speed is very much an illusion. The human ear can take just so many sounds. If you play each note clearly, it will sound fast because the ear has to process a lot of information. If you play so fast that either you miss notes, or they become a blur, it doesnâ€™t sound fast at all, it just sounds messy"

- "In short, make sure you are never ever practising wrong. Like Backaus, only practise the right notes."

Lack of strength is hardly the problem in piano playing. Anyone who has enough strength to make it through the day has enough strength to play a Beethoven concerto.

The problem is co-contraction of antagonistic muscles, i.e. not releasing a muscle in time before an antagonistic muscle contracts. The antagonistic muscle then not only has to overcome the resistance of the keys, but also the resistance of its counterpart muscle. This is a waste of energy and will affect both muscles at the same time. The often used term "relaxation" in piano playing refers to releasing a muscle before its counterpart contracts. Learning to realease and contract in time is a matter of coordination, not a matter of strength. Antagonistic muscle action in piano playing occurs, e.g., in lifting and lowering a finger and in forearm rotation, to name only two examples.
