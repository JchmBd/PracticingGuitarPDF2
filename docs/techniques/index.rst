   - intro text

   - Yes, practice tricks, hands separate, etc. are done for a very limited time only for the purpose of thoroughly learning and ingraining the movements. Once you get that, you simply play and enjoy the piece. Practising is a temporary process to be get rid of as soon as possible.  - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php/topic,3561.msg31700.html#msg31700

   - But above all, do not get lost in thought: try it out! All these methods are powerful, but they all have limitations and situations where they will fall apart. The only way to find out is trying them out.

   - "the secret for acquiring technique quickly lies in knowing certain tricks for reducing impossibly difficult passages to not only playable but also to trivially simple ones." - chang?

   - nothing mindless, play and observe

   - "Yes. You must avoid this. Use a timer. Also, there is a law of diminishing returns. As you practise a section you start by making lots of mistakes and learning form your mistakes. This is the exploratory phase. After a while you figure out all the co-ordinates and you pay it perfectly. A lot of beginners stop practising at this point. This is actually the point where real practice starts: when you finally got it right. Up to now most of your practice will have consisted of wrong repetitions. Now you must ingrain the correct section by repeating it at least as many times as you did it wrong in the exploratory phase. However, after a while of repeating perfect renditions of your passage, due to fatigue (both mental and physical) you will start making mistakes again. It is very important that you stop practising before getting to this stage. You must stop when your repeats are perfect. But being human, your reaction when you start making mistakes again is to keep repeating to try to re-achieve your former perfection. You will not be able to. In fact all you will achieve is several hours of wrong repetitions. Next day, of course the whole section is a mess even though you may have practised it for five hours. So make sure that your last repeat is always perfect: this is what will be ingrained in your brain." - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php/topic,4689.msg44184.html#msg44184

   - "Speed is a function of movement. Speed walls are always a result of using a movement that has limitations. Rather than trying to break through the speed wall by persistent (and misguided) overpractice of the same movement, go around the speed wall by using a completely different movement." - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=5298.msg50376#msg50376

   - "The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Just give it a try. But not a half-hearted try. Give it all you get. Do not dismiss it straight away."

   - Hands

     - Cycling (same groups of notes)

     - Alternating hands

     - Chunking (on beats - chunking)

     - Hands separate

     - Rhythmic variations - dotted rhythms.  "The most important thing to watch for when doing RV, is to make sure you practice the mirror variation. This means that you do not just do fast-slow, you must also do slow-fast. And if you use a more complex rhythm (which I encourage you to do). Like slow-slow-fast, then make sure you go through slow-fast-slow and fast-fast-slow as well." - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php/topic,5298.msg50376.html#msg50376

     - Rhythmic variations, longer section

     - Accent variations

     - Rest variations

     - Stressing - irregular

     - Stressing - regular

     - Volume swells

     - Pianissimo

     - Isolating and integrating

     - Vary picking approach

     - Repeated note groups (For instance, if you chose a passage with 5 notes/chords, first work on 1-2, then 2-3, then 3-4, then 4-5. Once you can do those with ease, do 123, 234 and 345. Then 1234 and 2345. Finally play the whole passage 12345. You can use this method for units larger than notes, e.g. triplets, or bars and even lines. Do not try this with passages larger than 7-8 units (it will take all day).  - ref https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=4858.msg46594#msg46594, starting at "it overrides the 20 minute rule."

     - Forward chaining

     - Backward chaining

     - Sequencing (e.g, for 1-2-3-4-5 lick, play 1-2-3-4, then 2-3-4-5- etc)
 
     - left hand only: staccato hammers

     - silent chord press

     - starting and stopping

     - staccato picking

     - ghosting (polyphony)

     - left hand only: chord attack / parallel set

     - Mental practice
