   Chaining on steroids: take a passage, and briefly work on the two-note chains starting at every single note.  Then do three-note chains, then four, and so on, until you've thoroughly explored every twist and turn.

(For instance, if you chose a passage with 5 notes/chords, first work on 1-2, then 2-3, then 3-4, then 4-5. Once you can do those with ease, do 123, 234 and 345. Then 1234 and 2345. Finally play the whole passage 12345. You can use this method for units larger than notes, e.g. triplets, or bars and even lines. Do not try this with passages larger than 7-8 units (it will take all day).  - ref www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=4858.msg46594#msg46594, starting at "it overrides the 20 minute rule."

This one is really tough.  Warning, I haven't managed to do it strictly, but it's good.

Applied it ot Eric J lick.  Almost to the whole thing that is 12 notes. Really takes a long time. Spent 45 minutes, didn't even manage to do the entire cycle of 12 notes. But still pretty good.  Good at finding tight spots, and staying loose whole time.  Stay loose, always loose.
