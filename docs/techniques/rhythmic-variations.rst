   Play a section with varying rhythms.  For straight 8ths or 16ths, play with dotted rhythms (slow-fast and fast-slow), and vice-versa.

"The most important thing to watch for when doing RV, is to make sure you practice the mirror variation. This means that you do not just do fast-slow, you must also do slow-fast. And if you use a more complex rhythm (which I encourage you to do). Like slow-slow-fast, then make sure you go through slow-fast-slow and fast-fast-slow as well." - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php/topic,5298.msg50376.html#msg50376
