   Play a section with varying rhythms.  For straight 8ths or 16ths, play with dotted rhythms (slow-fast and fast-slow), and vice-versa.

Practicing a passage with different rhythmic variations can help you break through speed barriers, uncover weaknesses, and smooth out your playing.  It works for beginners and advanced players.

.. note::

   If you're not sure how to read rhythmic notation, see :ref:`reading-rhythms`.

For example, take this scalar lick, strictly alternate picked, which you're aiming to play at 170 bpm:

.. vextab::

   :16 5d-7u-5-4-5-7u/3 5d-6-8-5-6-8u/2 5d-7-8-7/1 | :w 8/1

You can play the same lick at 170 bpm, but play it with dotted rhythms instead of straight sixteenths.  For example, here's the first 8 notes of the lick, with dotted notes to make the rhythm "slow-fast":

.. vextab::
   :debug:

   :8d 5d/3 :16 7u/3 :8d 5d/3 :16 4u/3 :8d 5d/3 :16 7u/3
   :8d 5d/2 :16 6u/2 :8d 8d/2 :16 5u/2

You can, and should, also play it with the dot on the other note, to make the rhythm "fast-slow":

.. vextab::
   :debug:

   :16 5d/3 :8d 7u/3 :16 5d/3 :8d 4u/3 :16 5d/3 :8d 7u/3
   :16 5d/2 :8d 6u/2 :16 8d/2 :8d 5u/2


"The most important thing to watch for when doing RV, is to make sure you practice the mirror variation. This means that you do not just do fast-slow, you must also do slow-fast. And if you use a more complex rhythm (which I encourage you to do). Like slow-slow-fast, then make sure you go through slow-fast-slow and fast-fast-slow as well." - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php/topic,5298.msg50376.html#msg50376
