   Play a section with varying rhythms.  For straight 8ths or 16ths, play with dotted rhythms (slow-fast and fast-slow), and vice-versa.

Practicing a passage with different rhythmic variations can help you break through speed barriers, uncover weaknesses, and smooth out your playing.  It works for beginners and advanced players.

   If you're not sure how to read rhythmic notation, see :ref:`reading-rhythms`.

For example, take this scalar lick, strictly alternate picked, which you're aiming to play at 170 bpm:

.. vextab::
   :example: pending

   :16 5d-7-5-4-5-7u/3 5d-6-8-5-6-8u/2 5d-7-8-7/1 | :h 8/1

You can play the same lick at 170 bpm, but play it with dotted rhythms instead of straight sixteenths.  For example, here's the first 8 notes of the lick, with dotted notes to make the rhythm "slow-fast":

.. vextab::
   :width: 700
   :example: pending
   
   :8d 5d/3 :16 7u/3 :8d 5d/3 :16 4u/3 :8d 5d/3 :16 7u/3
   :8d 5d/2 :16 6u/2 :8d 8d/2 :16 5u/2

You can, and should, also play it with the dot on the other note, to make the rhythm "fast-slow":

.. vextab::
   :width: 700
   :example: pending

   :16 5d/3 :8d 7u/3 :16 5d/3 :8d 4u/3 :16 5d/3 :8d 7u/3
   :16 5d/2 :8d 6u/2 :16 8d/2 :8d 5u/2

Why this works
--------------

Rhythmic variations are a **super** technique for several reasons:

1. When playing fast passages, there are many things going on - your fingers, hands, and mind are all working hard.  If any one one of them tense up or stumble, things fall parant.  The long note gives your mind and body time to think about and prepare for the next note.

2. The short break afforded by the longer dotted note gives you time to release any accumulated tension.

3. You can try pushing faster!  Check out the three rhythmic variations of the same lick below:

.. vextab::
   :width: 700
   :example: pending

   tabstave notation=true tablature=false
   notes =|: :16 5d-7-5-4/3 =:: :8d 5d/3 :16 7u/3 :8d 5d/3 :16 4u/3 =:: :16 5d/3 :8d 7u/3 :16 5d/3 :8d 4u/3 =:|
   options space=20

The first variation is one beat (four 16ths), but the last two are both 2 beats, so the last two are slower ... however, the second and fourth notes of all of these variations are still 16th notes!  For these fast notes, you will still have to make the same motions in the same timeframe as you would for the initial straight-16ths version, but your hands and brain will have a lot of time to rest and prepare.

You can also try lengthening the long note even further, if it helps:

.. vextab::
   :width: 700
   :example: pending

   tabstave notation=true tablature=false
   notes =|: :q 5d/3 :8d t5/3 :16 7u/3 :q 5d/3 :8d t5/3 :16 4u/3 =::
   notes :16 5d/3 :8d 7u/3 :q t7/3 :16 5d/3 :8d 4u/3 :q t4/3 =:|
   options space=20

The key is consistency and accuracy of the rhythm.  Keep the notes clearly defined and articulated!

If you stay focused and loose, you may find that you can play the same lick with dotted rhythms at much higher tempos than you would for straight 16ths, while still being accurate with the fast sixteenth notes.  When you return to straight 16ths at lower tempos, it will be easier.

   The most important thing to watch for when doing rhythmic variation work is to make sure you practice the mirror variation. This means that you do not just do fast-slow, you must also do slow-fast. And if you use a more complex rhythm (which I encourage you to do). Like slow-slow-fast, then make sure you go through slow-fast-slow and fast-fast-slow as well. `bernhard, pianostreet.com <https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php/topic,5298.msg50376.html#msg50376>`_
