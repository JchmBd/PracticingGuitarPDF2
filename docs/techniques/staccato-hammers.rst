   For any passage with complex left hand movements, play with loud, distinct, clear stacatto hammers, at a slow tempo.

Legato scale practice

Fingers in position above string
staccato touch
pianissimo, all attention on fingertips
down with one finger, up with the adjacent, synchronized
*slight* press of the string once fretted, to strengthen the connection

This is tiring work, for the central nervous system.
