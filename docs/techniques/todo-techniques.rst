Other Techniques
================

These techniques that still require documentation.  In some cases, they have rough notes, which are reminders for me of points I wish to reference or include in the final documentation.

Regular Accents
---------------

.. tech:technique:: regularaccents
   :displayname: Regular accents
   :status: todo

   Accent all notes at the start of every beat.  This adds structure for your mind and for listeners.

If a pianist plays a passage without regular natural accentuation (these accents should be very light, hardly
audible), no matter how distinct his finger work is, he
will give his listeners the impression that his playing is
somewhat indistinct. Regularity of metrical division is
important for clear auditory perception of performed music as well as for execution,

When any exercise, scale or section of a passage is singled out for
practice, it must always be divided into clearly accented,
regular metrical groups. It must also be finished on the
strong beat to give a proper feeling for the end of the unit.


Chaining
--------



Chunking (on beats - chunking)
------------------------------

"If we try to play a scale or passage without dividing
it into several groups with regular accents, then for each
movement of each single finger a separate willimpulse
must be sent from the central nervous system. In this
way we would be able to play our scale in slow tempo
only. Uniting two notes in one group by an accent on
the first note will enable us to play a given succession
somewhat faster because now only one will-impulse is
needed to produce two tones. The faster we want to play,
the greater the number of tones that have to be united
into one group. Thus, many volitional impulses, each
directed to a single action, would be replaced by a few
directed to the compound action. For exceedingly rapid
scale playing (in the finale of Chopin’s G minor Ballade,
for example), we should unite seven notes in one will
impulse. By doing so we gain the advantage of playing
the regularly repeated patterns of notes and finger successions with octave orientation. Because of this orientation, it is easier to unite seven notes in one group than
six or eight. Thus, at each strong beat we send a will
impulse and are not conscious of the notes which are
played between these strong beats. These links have been
worked out previously and stored in the motor region of
the cortex.

can't join chunks?

In fact he would
soon also be able to play it fast in its entirety, but with
frequent stops at definite points: at the end of each
measure or every two measures, During these stops he
would have an opportunity to prepare himself for the
next section. But to learn to play this piece fast and without stops the pupil would have to learn to think fast.

Cycling (same groups of notes)
------------------------------

Ghosting (polyphony)
------------------------------

Dropping notes
----------------

Polyphonic only?

Break it down
------------------------------

RH only, LH only

B notes: https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=3371.msg30144#msg30144

Get it faster than HT
RH: eg with straight 16ths and string switching, can just make a static chord shape with FH (and even mute), and play with string switches.

LH: fast and even, hammers only.


Isolating and integrating
------------------------------

Left hand only: chord attack / parallel set
-------------------------------------------

If you can't play it with the left hand only, you can't pick it.

Left hand only: staccato hammers
---------------------------------

Mental practice
------------------------------

“The full acoustic picture of the music must be lodged in the mind, before it can be expressed through the hands.” Then the “playing is simply the manual expression of something [a pianist] knows.”™
—Josef Hofmann

It should be a rule that everything has to be played
without mistakes from the very beginning, to save time
and energy.

1 analyze, 2 play at slow tempo, 3 

"Walter Gieseking once said that the main factor in technique is the brain; the main condition for technique is
concentration; and the main subject of technique is evenness."

“A player's fingers cannot travel faster than the
thoughts which direct his fmgers on the keyboard. ‘Therefore his velocity depends first on his mental agility in
grasping printed music and coordinating finger movements.”


Outlining
-------------------

only play the "main" notes of a phrase, and make sure they're clearly accented in your mind.

Pianissimo
------------------------------

Repeated note groups
------------------------------

(For instance, if you chose a passage with 5 notes/chords, first work on 1-2, then 2-3, then 3-4, then 4-5. Once you can do those with ease, do 123, 234 and 345. Then 1234 and 2345. Finally play the whole passage 12345. You can use this method for units larger than notes, e.g. triplets, or bars and even lines. Do not try this with passages larger than 7-8 units (it will take all day).  - ref https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=4858.msg46594#msg46594, starting at "it overrides the 20 minute rule."

chunks of 2, 3, 4 notes, etc.
keep the picking correct (upstroke/downstroke)

Rest variations
------------------------------

Sequencing
------------------------------

(e.g, for 1-2-3-4-5 lick, play 1-2-3-4, then 2-3-4-5- etc)

Silent chord press
------------------------------

Slow practice
--------------

It is
the task of the teacher to strengthen both the inhibitory
and the excitatory processes.

In such cases, it is important that all movements be
executed energetically. It should be emphasized that slow
playing does not necessarily mean slow motion. The
movements must be swift but clearly separated from each
other.

In such cases, it is important that all movements be
executed energetically. It should be emphasized that slow
playing does not necessarily mean slow motion. The
movements must be swift but clearly separated from each
other. Deep legato practicing is extremely useful for
strengthening weak nervous processes. After-pressure of
each finger is recommended.

But attention! De not allow any overexertion of the
participating muscles or involvement of unnecessary ones.
The best control can be realized in the following way:
while pressing a key rather strongly, try to move the wrist
up and down smoothly and evenly, sensing its flexibility.
Combining strong finger grasp with a flexible wrist is one
of the main problems of piano technique. The teacher
must strive to develop this ability in his pupils.

Staccato picking
------------------------------

Starting and stopping
------------------------------

The ability to play evenly and the ability to
slow down at any point in a passage serve as criteria of
precise and sufficient inhibition.


Vary picking approach
------------------------------

Volume swells
------------------------------

crescendo and decr - of RH picking
