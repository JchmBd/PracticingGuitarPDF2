(Pending Documentation)
=======================

These techniques that still require documentation.  In some cases, they have rough notes, which are reminders for me of points I wish to reference or include in the final documentation.

----------


Regular Accents
---------------

.. tech:technique:: regularaccents
   :displayname: Regular accents
   :status: todo

   Accent all notes at the start of every beat.  This adds structure for your mind and for listeners.

If a pianist plays a passage without regular natural accentuation (these accents should be very light, hardly
audible), no matter how distinct his finger work is, he
will give his listeners the impression that his playing is
somewhat indistinct. Regularity of metrical division is
important for clear auditory perception of performed music as well as for execution,

When any exercise, scale or section of a passage is singled out for
practice, it must always be divided into clearly accented,
regular metrical groups. It must also be finished on the
strong beat to give a proper feeling for the end of the unit.


Chaining
--------

.. tech:technique:: chaining
   :displayname: Chaining
   :status: TODO

   Play two notes perfectly, at speed.  Then add notes before it (back chaining) of after it (forward chaining).

Chunking
--------

.. tech:technique:: chunking
   :displayname: Chunking
   :status: TODO

   Take one long phrase or idea, and break it up into chunks, with clearly identified "target notes" at the start of each chunk.  When practicing and playing, aim for these target notes.

"If we try to play a scale or passage without dividing
it into several groups with regular accents, then for each
movement of each single finger a separate willimpulse
must be sent from the central nervous system. In this
way we would be able to play our scale in slow tempo
only. Uniting two notes in one group by an accent on
the first note will enable us to play a given succession
somewhat faster because now only one will-impulse is
needed to produce two tones. The faster we want to play,
the greater the number of tones that have to be united
into one group. Thus, many volitional impulses, each
directed to a single action, would be replaced by a few
directed to the compound action. For exceedingly rapid
scale playing (in the finale of Chopin’s G minor Ballade,
for example), we should unite seven notes in one will
impulse. By doing so we gain the advantage of playing
the regularly repeated patterns of notes and finger successions with octave orientation. Because of this orientation, it is easier to unite seven notes in one group than
six or eight. Thus, at each strong beat we send a will
impulse and are not conscious of the notes which are
played between these strong beats. These links have been
worked out previously and stored in the motor region of
the cortex.

can't join chunks?

In fact he would
soon also be able to play it fast in its entirety, but with
frequent stops at definite points: at the end of each
measure or every two measures, During these stops he
would have an opportunity to prepare himself for the
next section. But to learn to play this piece fast and without stops the pupil would have to learn to think fast.

Outlining: only play the "main" notes of a phrase, and make sure they're clearly accented in your mind.


Break it down
-------------

.. tech:technique:: breakitdown
   :displayname: Break it down
   :status: TODO

   Break any movement into distinct building blocks, and practice those building blocks separately, aiming for higher speeds than your target tempo.  Then combine them.

RH only, LH only

B notes: https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=3371.msg30144#msg30144

Get it faster than HT
RH: eg with straight 16ths and string switching, can just make a static chord shape with FH (and even mute), and play with string switches.

LH: fast and even, hammers only.

Isolating and integrating


Chord Attack
------------

.. tech:technique:: chordattack
   :displayname: Chord Attack
   :status: TODO

   Explore left hand technical issues by reducing consecutive notes to a single chord (eftecively playing those chunks at infinite speed), and then gradually arpeggiate those notes.

Left hand only: chord attack / parallel set

.. todo:: better name for this?

If you can't play it with the left hand only, you can't pick it.

Staccato Hammers
----------------

.. tech:technique:: stacattohammers
   :displayname: Stacatto Hammers
   :status: TODO

   For any passage with complex left hand movements, play with loud, distinct, clear stacatto hammers, at a slow tempo.

Legato scale practice

Fingers in position above string
staccato touch
pianissimo, all attention on fingertips
down with one finger, up with the adjacent, synchronized
*slight* press of the string once fretted, to strengthen the connection

This is tiring work, for the central nervous system.

Mental practice
---------------

.. tech:technique:: mentalpractice
   :displayname: Mental Practice
   :status: TODO

   Play away from the instrument.

“The full acoustic picture of the music must be lodged in the mind, before it can be expressed through the hands.” Then the “playing is simply the manual expression of something [a pianist] knows.”™
—Josef Hofmann

It should be a rule that everything has to be played
without mistakes from the very beginning, to save time
and energy.

"Walter Gieseking once said that the main factor in technique is the brain; the main condition for technique is
concentration; and the main subject of technique is evenness."

“A player's fingers cannot travel faster than the
thoughts which direct his fmgers on the keyboard. ‘Therefore his velocity depends first on his mental agility in
grasping printed music and coordinating finger movements.”


achieve technique, not by the amount of time spent in
practicing, but by the quality of this labor, by the strength
of will and attention directing the mind on musical problems. Hugo Riemann wrote: “It is impossible to develop
velocity otherwise than through exercise of the telegraphic
apparatus from brain to muscles. The process from withinoutward cannot be replaced by anything.” Theodor
Leschetizky used to say that intellect played the chief
part in correct study; he recommended correcting mistakes mentally before playing a passage again.

It is evident, then, that the main attention of thoughtful pianists and piano teachers should be directed to
questions connected with the activity of the central nervous system. The roots of technique are in our central
nervous system, The problems connected with muscular
conditions and outward appearance of our playing apparatus are important, but they are secondary.


Repeated Note Groups
--------------------

.. tech:technique:: repeatednotegroups
   :displayname: Repeated Note Groups
   :status: TODO

   Chaining on steroids: take a passage, and briefly work on the two-note chains starting at every single note.  Then do three-note chains, then four, and so on, until you've thoroughly explored every twist and turn.

(For instance, if you chose a passage with 5 notes/chords, first work on 1-2, then 2-3, then 3-4, then 4-5. Once you can do those with ease, do 123, 234 and 345. Then 1234 and 2345. Finally play the whole passage 12345. You can use this method for units larger than notes, e.g. triplets, or bars and even lines. Do not try this with passages larger than 7-8 units (it will take all day).  - ref www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=4858.msg46594#msg46594, starting at "it overrides the 20 minute rule."

Slow Practice
-------------

.. tech:technique:: slowpractice
   :displayname: Slow Practice
   :status: TODO

   At the end of every practice session, play things at a slow tempo -- but not in slow motion.

It is
the task of the teacher to strengthen both the inhibitory
and the excitatory processes.

In such cases, it is important that all movements be
executed energetically. It should be emphasized that slow
playing does not necessarily mean slow motion. The
movements must be swift but clearly separated from each
other.

In such cases, it is important that all movements be
executed energetically. It should be emphasized that slow
playing does not necessarily mean slow motion. The
movements must be swift but clearly separated from each
other. Deep legato practicing is extremely useful for
strengthening weak nervous processes. After-pressure of
each finger is recommended.

But attention! De not allow any overexertion of the
participating muscles or involvement of unnecessary ones.
The best control can be realized in the following way:
while pressing a key rather strongly, try to move the wrist
up and down smoothly and evenly, sensing its flexibility.
Combining strong finger grasp with a flexible wrist is one
of the main problems of piano technique. The teacher
must strive to develop this ability in his pupils.

Staccato picking
----------------

.. tech:technique:: staccatopicking
   :displayname: Staccato Picking
   :status: TODO

   Periodically, use the pick to stop any string from ringing immediately after you've picked it.  This regulates the strength of your impulses, and exercises the inhibitory reflex.

Fancy words.

Stop and Go
-----------

.. tech:technique:: stopandgo
   :displayname: Stop and Go
   :status: TODO

   Ensure your physical and mental processes are under control by intentionally interrupting (stopping) them periodically.

The ability to play evenly and the ability to
slow down at any point in a passage serve as criteria of
precise and sufficient inhibition.


Dynamics
--------

.. tech:technique:: dynamics
   :displayname: Dynamics
   :status: TODO

   Fine-tune your control by varying the volume of your playing using only your hands and fingers.

From "Proprioception" section::

Proprioceptive sensations and the ability to make the finest inner analysis and synthesis of these sensations are necessary for acquiring motor skill. These motor signals also represent the only material through which our motor centers operate, the basis on which dexterous motor acts are built and developed. Hence, when aiming for the most efficient piano practicing, we have to take care that our proprioceptive sensations are clear and distinct. Slow playing serves this aim to some extent.

From the physiological point of view the answer seems to be that, while practicing, fingers should be raised to obtain the most distinct sensations from their action, but only as much as is needed for this purpose.

A slight pressure into the key after its full depression is recommended in slow practicing. Tactile sensations as well as sensations from finger muscle contractions will be strengthened in this way.

Practicing legato passages with staccato touch will “engrave more firmly on your memory the order in which the notes (and the fingers which produce those notes) follow each other.” It will also sharpen proprioceptive sensations from the more distinct activity of fngers. This practicing must be finger staccato as distinct from hand staccato or forearm staccato. Soft playing should prevail, since in forte the unavoidable participation of upper parts of the playing apparatus (big muscles) would overshadow finer finger sensations.

Therefore, among several varieties of practice for finger articulation, the following is one of the best: first, fingers are prepared on the keys to be pressed. Each finger then presses with a light downward movement only, never leaving its key. Thus the size of finger movement is equal to the depth of the key.  And playing proceeds very slowly, pianissimo, with the whole attention concentrated on fingertips. The downward movement of one finger must be synchronized with the movement of the preceding finger as it lets its key rise. At the slightest sensation of fatigue in the upper parts of the arm, this practicing should be stopped. (It is rather hard to hold the weight of the forearm without support.) By experimenting, the proper balance will be found, so that longer sections and eventually a whole study or piece can be played in this way. Such practicing is tiring to our central nervous system, as it requires finest tonal control along with control over the accompanying sensations, and this is especially hard in pianissimo. But the consequence of such practicing is a feeling of strength in the fingers. This result would be surprising to the representatives of the old finger school. Of course it is not muscle, but nerve command over the fingers that is being strengthened!
