Reading rhythms
===============

*Just enough* notation for you to read any examples in this book.  (There's much more to this topic: ties, rests, tuples, etc.)  For the purposes of the examples, it's better that you get a *feel* for the rhythm in your ears and hands, so listen to the examples for each and maybe play along.

The basics
**********

.. vextab::
   :width: 400
   :example: snap-fingers.mp3

   tabstave notation=true
   notes :q 0/2 $1$ 0/2 $2$ 0/2 $3$ 0/2 $4$

.. vextab::
   :width: 400

   tabstave notation=true
   notes :8 0/2 $1$ 0/2 $and$ 0/2 $2$ 0/2 $and$

.. vextab::
   :width: 400

   tabstave notation=true
   notes :16 0/2 $1$ 0/2 $e$ 0/2 $and$ 0/2 $a$ 0/2 $2$ 0/2 $e$ 0/2 $and$ 0/2 $a$

Dotted rhythms
**************

A dot after a note increases its length by half its value.

.. vextab::
   :width: 400

   tabstave notation=true
   notes :8d 0/3 $1$ :16 0/3 $a$ :8d 0/3 $2$ :16 0/3 $a$
   
.. vextab::
   :width: 400

   tabstave notation=true
   notes :16 0/3 $1$ :8d 0/3 $e$ :16 0/3 $2$ :8d 0/3 $e$

Triplets
********

.. vextab::
   :width: 400

   tabstave notation=true
   notes :q 0/3 $1...$ 0/3 $2...$ :8 0/3 $3$ 0/3 $la$ 0/3 $li$ ^3^ 0/3 $4$ 0/3 $la$ 0/3 $li$ ^3^
   
.. vextab::
   :width: 600

   tabstave notation=true time=12/8
   notes :q 0/3 $1...$ 0/3 $2...$ :16 0/3 $3$ 0/3 $ta$ 0/3 $la$ 0/3 $ta$ 0/3 $li$ 0/3 $ta$ 0/3 $4$ 0/3 $ta$ 0/3 $la$ 0/3 $ta$ 0/3 $li$ 0/3 $ta$

Some people like different words to say for each beat ... e.g, "1-trip-let" or "1-and-uh" for triplets, instead of "1-la-li".  Use whatever works for you.

A Short Exercise
****************

This might help you internalize reading and the sound of some of the above building blocks!  We're just playing a single note, so no tab is included.  For the recording, each measure is played twice.


.. vextab::
   :width: 400

   tabstave notation=true tablature=false
   notes =:| :q 0-0-0-0/3 =:|

   tabstave notation=true tablature=false
   notes =:| :q 0-0/3 :8 0-0-0-0/3 =:|

   tabstave notation=true tablature=false
   notes =:| :q 0-0/3 :16 0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0/3 =:|

   tabstave notation=true tablature=false
   notes =:| :q 0-0/3 :8d 0/3 :16 0/3 :8d 0/3 :16 0/3 =:|
 
   tabstave notation=true tablature=false
   notes =:| :q 0-0/3 :16 0/3 :8d 0/3 :16 0/3 :8d 0/3 =:|


More drills
***********

There are lots of books and tutorials out there for reading rhythms.  Some I like are:

* `Modern Reading Text in 4/4 For All Instruments <https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Reading-Text-All-Instruments/dp/0769233775>`_
* `Rhythmic Training <https://www.amazon.com/Rhythmic-Training-Robert-Starer/dp/0881889768>`_
