To do
=====

Requiring documentation:

- Relaxation

- General practice thoughts

- Time to spend practicing (https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=3039.msg26757#msg26757, 15-20 mins, 7x) -- "At this point comes the 20 minute principle. Do not play this first bar anymore today! Nothing bad will happen if in your next 20 minute practice session you work on this first bar again. But nothing good will happen either: It will be a total waste of time. Instead take your break, and on the next session work on a different passage of the prelude."

- the importance of experimentation and tracking results

- making a plan: "This demands a lot of thought, organisation, the self-discipline to stick to a pre-planned schedule. Plan your work, and then work your plan." - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=4858.msg46586#msg46586

- memorizing a new piece (https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=3039.msg28102#msg28102)

- start with the difficult thing

- the last repeat must be perfect

- slow and fast practice

- investigative vs real practice - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=4858.msg46585#msg46585

- metronome work (Jens L, and xylophone variations), and 60 – 92 – 80 – 100 – 92 – 112 – 100 – 132 – 112 – 152 – 120

- "Method" - "It is more like a set of principles that have to be investigated and adapted to each person's idiossincracies. Try it out, keep what works, discard what does not. And sometimes go back to something you discarded, you may understand it better now and derive some benefit from it." - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=4851.msg85705#msg85705

- test it out: "Pick two pieces of similar difficulty/style. One of them you learn exactly the way you would have you had never heard of these maps. The other one you learn by following (the best you can) the instructions given. In a couple of week’s time (or more, or less), compare results and tell us." - https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=5083.msg48306#msg48306

- "Speed is very much an illusion. The human ear can take just so many sounds. If you play each note clearly, it will sound fast because the ear has to process a lot of information. If you play so fast that either you miss notes, or they become a blur, it doesn’t sound fast at all, it just sounds messy"

- "In short, make sure you are never ever practising wrong. Like Backaus, only practise the right notes."
